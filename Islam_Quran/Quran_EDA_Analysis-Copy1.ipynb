Ye have indeed wronged yourselves by your worship of the calf: So turn (in repentance) to your Maker\",\" and slay yourselves (the wrong-doers); that will be better for you in the sight of your Maker.\"\" Then He turned towards you (in forgiveness): For He is Oft-Returning\", Most Merciful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\\\r\\\\n\"2|55|And remember ye said: \"\"O Moses! We shall never believe in thee until we see Allah manifestly\",\" but ye were dazed with thunder and lighting even as ye looked on.\\\\r\\\\n2|56|Then We raised you up after your death: Ye had the chance to be grateful.\\\\r\\\\n2|57|And We gave you the shade of clouds and sent down to you Manna and quails, saying: Eat of the good things We have provided for you:\"\" (But they rebelled); to us they did no harm\", but they harmed their own souls.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\\\r\\\\n\"2|58|And remember We said: \"\"Enter this town\", and eat of the plenty therein as ye wish; but enter the gate with humility, in posture and in words,\" and We shall forgive you your faults and increase (the portion of) those who do good.\"\"\",,,,,,,,,,,,,\\\\r\\\\n2|59|But the transgressors changed the word from that which had been given them; so We sent on the transgressors a plague from heaven, for that they infringed (Our command) repeatedly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\\\r\\\\n\"2|60|And remember Moses prayed for water for his people; We said: \"\"Strike the rock with thy staff.\"\" Then gushed forth therefrom twelve springs. Each group knew its own place for water. So eat and drink of the sustenance provided by Allah\", and do no evil nor mischief on the (face of the) earth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\\\r\\\\n\"2|61|And remember ye said: \"\"O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food (always); so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth\", -its pot-herbs, and cucumbers, Its garlic, lentils,\" and onions.\"\" He said: \"\"Will ye exchange the better for the worse? Go ye down to any town\",\" and ye shall find what ye want!\"\" They were covered with humiliation and misery; they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah. This because they went on rejecting the Signs of Allah and slaying His Messengers without just cause.

Now do what ye are commanded!\"\"\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\\\r\\\\n\"2|69|They said: \"\"Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us Her colour.\"\" He said: \"\"He says: A fawn-coloured heifer\", pure and rich in tone,\" the admiration of beholders!\"\"\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\\\r\\\\n\"2|70|They said: \"\"Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what she is: To us are all heifers alike: We wish indeed for guidance\",\" if Allah wills.\"\"\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\\\r\\\\n\"2|71|He said: \"\"He says: A heifer not trained to till the soil or water the fields; sound and without blemish.\"\" They said: \"\"Now hast thou brought the truth.\"\" Then they offered her in sacrifice\", but not with good-will.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\\\r\\\\n2|72|Remember ye slew a man and fell into a dispute among yourselves as to the crime: But Allah was to bring forth what ye did hide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\\\r\\\\n\"2|73|So We said: \"\"Strike the (body) with a piece of the (heifer).\"\" Thus Allah bringeth the dead to life and showeth you His Signs: Perchance ye may understand.\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\\\r\\\\n2|74|Thenceforth were your hearts hardened: They became like a rock and even worse in hardness.

Then did ye turn back, except a few among you, and ye backslide (even now).,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\\\r\\\\n2|84|And remember We took your covenant (to this effect): Shed no blood amongst you, nor turn out your own people from your homes: and this ye solemnly ratified, and to this ye can bear witness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\\\r\\\\n2|85|After this it is ye, the same people, who slay among yourselves, and banish a party of you from their homes; assist (Their enemies) against them, in guilt and rancour; and if they come to you as captives, ye ransom them, though it was not lawful for you to banish them. Then is it only a part of the Book that ye believe in, and do ye reject the rest? but what is the reward for those among you who behave like this but disgrace in this life?- and on the Day of Judgment they shall be consigned to the most grievous penalty.

Now the man of his own religion appealed to him against his foe,\" and Moses struck him with his fist and made an end of him. He said: \"\"This is a work of Evil (Satan): for he is an enemy that manifestly misleads!\"\"\",,,,,,,,,,,,\\\\r\\\\n\"28|16|He prayed: \"\"O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul!

Each group knew its own place for water. So eat and drink of the sustenance provided by Allah\", and do no evil nor mischief on the (face of the) earth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\\\r\\\\n\"2|61|And remember ye said: \"\"O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food (always); so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth\", -its pot-herbs, and cucumbers, Its garlic, lentils,\" and onions.\"\" He said: \"\"Will ye exchange the better for the worse? Go ye down to any town\",\" and ye shall find what ye want!\"\" They were covered with humiliation and misery; they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah.

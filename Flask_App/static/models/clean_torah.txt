in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth
the earth was unformed and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god hovered over the face of the waters
god said there be and there was light
god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness
god called the light day and the darkness he called night and there was evening and there was morning one day
and god said there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the
god made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so
god called the firmament heaven and there was evening and there was morning a second day
and god said the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land and it was so
god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of the waters called he seas and god saw that it was good
god said the earth put forth grass herb yielding seed and fruittree bearing fruit after its kind wherein is the seed thereof upon the and it was so
the earth brought forth grass herb yielding seed after its kind and tree bearing fruit wherein is the seed thereof after its kind and god saw that it was good
and there was evening and there was morning a third day
and god said there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years
let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the and it was so
god made the two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night and the stars
god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth
to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good
there was evening and there was morning a fourth day
and god said the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures and let fowl fly above the earth in the open firmament of
god created the great seamonsters and every living creature that creepeth wherewith the waters swarmed after its kind and every winged fowl after its kind and god saw that it was good

and god said the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after its and it was so
and god made the beast of the earth after its kind and the cattle after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the ground after its kind and god saw that it was good
god said us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them
god blessed them and god said unto them fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that creepeth upon the
god said i have given you every herb yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding you it shall be for food
to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is a living soul i have given every green herb for and it was so
god saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very good and there was evening and there was morning the sixth day and the heaven and the earth were finished and all the host of them
on the seventh day god finished his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made
god blessed the seventh day and hallowed it because that in it he rested from all his work which god in creating had made
these are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god made earth and heaven
no shrub of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground
but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground
the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul
the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed
and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good
genesis and evil
a river went out of eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted and became four heads
name of the first is pishon that is it which compasseth the whole land of havilah where there is gold
the gold of that land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone
the name of the second river is gihon the same is it that compasseth the whole land of cush
and the name of the third river is a tigris that is it which goeth toward the east of asshur and the fourth river is the euphrates
the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it
the lord god commanded the man saying every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat
of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
and the lord god said is not good that the man should be alone i will make him a help meet for
and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them and whatsoever the man would call every living creature that was to be the name thereof
the man gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found a help meet for him
and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the place with flesh instead thereof
the rib which the lord god had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her unto the man
the man said is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called bwoman because she was taken out of
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh
they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman hath god said ye shall not eat of any tree of the
the woman said unto the serpent the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat
of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye
the serpent said unto the woman shall not surely die
god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as god knowing good and
when the woman saw that the tree was good
b a c heb hiddekel
heb issahah heb ish genesis for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and she gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat
the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed figleaves together and made themselves girdles
they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden toward the cool of the day and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden
the lord god called unto the man and said unto him art
he said heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid
he said told thee that thou wast naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not
the man said woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did
the lord god said unto the woman is this thou hast and the woman said serpent beguiled me and i did
the lord god said unto the serpent thou hast done this cursed art thou from among all cattle and from among all beasts of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life
and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed they shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise their
unto the woman he said will greatly multiply thy pain and thy travail in pain thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over
and unto adam he said thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life
thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field
the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou
the man called his name aeve because she was the mother of all living
the lord god made for adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them
and the lord god said the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for
therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken
so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden the cherubim and the flaming a
heb havvah that is life genesis sword which turned every way to keep the way to the tree of life and the man knew eve his wife and she conceived and bore cain and said have agotten a man with the help of the
again she bore his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground
in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord
abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering
unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell
the lord said unto cain art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen
thou doest well shall it not be lifted up and if thou doest not well sin coucheth at the door and unto thee is its desire but thou mayest rule over
cain spoke unto abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him
and the lord said unto cain is abel thy and he said know not am i my
he said hast thou done the voice of thy blood crieth unto me from the ground
and now cursed art thou from the ground which hath opened her mouth
to receive thy blood from thy hand
thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the
cain said unto the lord punishment is greater than i can bear
thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the land and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth and it will come to pass that whosoever findeth me will slay
the lord said unto him whosoever slayeth cain vengeance shall be taken on him and the lord set a sign for cain lest any finding him should smite him
and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of bnod on the east of eden
and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bore enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch
unto enoch was born irad and irad begot cmehujael and mehujael begot methushael and methushael begot lamech
lamech took unto him two wives the name of one was adah and the name of the other zillah

lamech said unto his wives adah and zillah hear my voice ye wives of lamech hearken unto my speech for i have slain a man for wounding me and a young man for bruising me
if cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly lamech seventy and sevenfold
and adam knew his wife again and she bore a son and called his name aseth god bhath appointed me another seed instead of abel for cain slew
to seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name enosh then began men to call upon the name of the lord this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god created man in the likeness of god made he him
and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created

all the days of lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years and he died
and noah was five hundred years old and noah begot shem ham and japheth and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them
the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were
a fair and they took them wives whomsoever they chose
the lord said spirit shall not abide in man for ever for that he also is flesh therefore shall his days be a hundred and twenty
nephilim were in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bore children to them the same were the mighty men that were of old the men of renown
and the lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually
it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart
the lord said will blot out man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and creeping thing and fowl of the air for it repenteth me that i have made

these are the generations of noah noah was in his generations a man righteous and wholehearted noah walked with god
noah begot three sons shem ham and japheth
and the earth was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence
god saw the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth heb nahem to comfort

this is how thou shalt make it the length of the ark three hundred cubits the breadth of it fifty cubits and the height of it thirty cubits
light shalt thou make to the ark and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make it
i behold i do bring the flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven every thing that is in the earth shall perish

noah did according unto all that the lord commanded him
and noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth
noah went in and his sons and his wife and his with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood
clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls and of every thing that creepeth upon the ground
went in two and two unto noah into the ark male and female as god commanded noah
and it came to pass after the seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth
the six hundredth year of life in the second month on the seventeenth day of the month on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were
genesis opened
the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights
in the selfsame day entered noah and shem and ham and japheth the sons of noah and wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark
and every beast after its kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind and every fowl after its kind every bird of every sort
they went in unto noah into the ark two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life
they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as god commanded him and the lord shut him in
the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters increased and bore up the ark and it was lifted up above the earth
the waters prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters
and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered
cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains were covered
and all flesh perished that moved upon the earth both fowl and cattle and beast and every swarming thing that swarmeth upon the earth and every man
in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life whatsoever was in the dry land died
and he blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground both man and cattle and creeping thing and fowl of the heaven and they were blotted out from the earth and noah only was left and they that were with him in the ark
and the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days and god remembered noah and every living thing and all the cattle that were with him in the ark and god made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters assuaged
fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained
and the waters returned from off the earth continually and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased
the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month upon the mountains of ararat
the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of the mountains seen
and it came to pass at the end of forty days that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made
and he sent forth a raven and it went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth
he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground
the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him to the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth and he put forth his hand
genesis and took her and brought her in unto him into the ark
he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark
the dove came in to him at eventide and lo in her mouth an oliveleaf freshly plucked so noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth
he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove and she returned not again unto him any more
and it came to pass in the six hundred and first year in the first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from off the earth and noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and behold the face of the ground was dried
in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth dry
and god spoke unto noah saying

beast every creeping thing and every fowl whatsoever moveth upon the earth after their families went forth out of the ark
and noah builded an altar unto the lord and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burntofferings on the altar
and the lord smelled the sweet savour and the lord said in his heart will not again curse the ground any more for sake for the imagination of heart is evil from his youth neither will i again smite any more every thing living as i have done
the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth
the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air and upon all wherewith the ground teemeth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered
moving thing that liveth shall be for food for you as the green herb have i given you all
only flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall ye not eat
and surely your blood of your lives will i require at the hand of every beast will i require it and at the hand of man even at the hand of every brother will i require the life of man
sheddeth blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man

and god spoke unto noah and to his sons with him saying
for me behold i establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you

i will establish my covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the
god said is the token of the covenant which i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations

it shall come to pass when i bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the cloud
that i will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh

they said one to another let us make brick and burn them and they had brick for stone and slime had they for mortar
they said let us build us a city and a tower with its top in heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole

the lord said they are one people and they have all one language and this is what they begin to do and now nothing will be withholden from them which they purpose to do
let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one
the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city

pharaoh called abram and said is this that thou hast done unto me why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife
saidst thou she is my sister so that i took her to be my wife now therefore behold thy wife take her and go thy
pharaoh gave men charge concerning him and they brought him on the way and his wife and all that he had and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the south
abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold
he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and ai
the place of the altar which he had made there at the first and abram called there on the name of the lord
lot also who went with abram had flocks and herds and tents
the
land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together
there was a strife between the herdmen of cattle and the herdmen of cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelt then in the land
abram said unto lot there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we are brethren
not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if thou wilt take the left hand then i will go to the right or if thou take the right hand then i will go to the
lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of the jordan that it was well watered every where before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah like the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou goest unto zoar
lot chose him all the plain of the jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other
dwelt in the land of canaan and lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and moved his tent as far as sodom
the men of sodom were wicked and sinners against the lord exceedingly
the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward
all the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy
genesis seed for ever
i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered
walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for unto thee will i give
abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the terebinths of mamre which are in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar arioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of goiim
they made war with bera king of sodom and with birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king of zeboiim and the king of same is zoar
these came as allies unto the vale of same is the salt sea
years they served chedorlaomer and in the thirteenth year they rebelled
in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him and smote the rephaim in ashterothkarnaim and the zuzim in ham and the emim in shavehkiriathaim
the horites in their mount seir unto elparan which is by the wilderness
they turned back and came to same is smote all the country of the amalekites and also the amorites that dwelt in hazazontamar
there went out the king of sodom and the king of gomorrah and the king of
admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of same is zoar and they set the battle in array against them in the vale of siddim
chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of goiim and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar four kings against the five
the vale of siddim was full of slime pits and the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled and they fell there and they that remained fled to the mountain
they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their victuals and went their way
they took lot son who dwelt in sodom and his goods and departed
and there came one that had escaped and told abram the he dwelt by the terebinths of mamre the amorite brother of eshcol and brother of aner and these were confederate with abram
when abram heard that his brother was taken captive he led forth his trained men born in his house three hundred and eighteen and pursued as far as dan
he divided himself against them by night he and his servants and smote them and pursued them unto hobah which is on the left hand of damascus
he brought back all the goods and also brought back his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people
the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him at the vale of
genesis same is the vale
and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was priest of god the most high
and he blessed him and said be abram of god most high maker of heaven and earth
blessed be god the most high who hath delivered thine enemies into thy and he gave him a tenth of all
and the king of sodom said unto abram me the persons and take the goods to
abram said to the king of sodom have lifted up my hand unto the lord god most high maker of heaven and earth
i will not take a thread nor a shoelatchet nor aught that is thine lest thou shouldest say i have made abram rich
only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men which went with me aner eshcol and mamre let them take their after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying not abram i am thy shield thy reward shall be exceeding
abram said lord god what wilt thou give me seeing i go hence childless and he that shall be possessor of my house is eliezer of
abram said to me thou hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is to be mine
behold the word of the lord came unto him saying man shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of
thine own bowels shall be thine
and he brought him forth abroad and said now toward heaven and count the stars if thou be able to count and he said unto him shall thy seed
he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness
he said unto him am the lord that brought thee out of ur of the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit
and he said lord god whereby shall i know that i shall inherit
and he said unto him me a heifer of three years old and a shegoat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtledove and a young
he took him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each half over against the other but the birds divided he not
and the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses and abram drove them away
it came to pass that when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram and lo a dread even a great darkness fell upon him
he said unto abram of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years
and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance
but thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age
in the fourth generation they shall come back hither for the
genesis iniquity of the amorite is not yet
and it came to pass that when the sun went down and there was thick darkness behold a smoking furnace and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces
that day the lord made a covenant with abram saying thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto the great river the river euphrates
the kenite and the kenizzite and the kadmonite
the hittite and the perizzite and the rephaim
the amorite and the canaanite and the girgashite and the now sarai wife bore him no children and she had a handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar
sarai said unto abram now the lord hath restrained me from bearing go in i pray thee unto my handmaid it may be that i shall be builded up through and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai
sarai wife took hagar the egyptian her handmaid after abram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to abram her husband to be his wife
he went in unto hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes
sarai said unto abram wrong be upon thee i gave my handmaid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was despised in her eyes the lord judge between me and
but abram said unto sarai
thy maid is in thy hand do to her that which is good in thine and sarai dealt harshly with her and she fled from her face
the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to shur
he said handmaid whence camest thou and whither goest and she said flee from the face of my mistress
the angel of the lord said unto her to thy mistress and submit thyself under her
the angel of the lord said unto her will greatly multiply thy seed that it shall not be numbered for multitude
the angel of the lord said unto her thou art with child and shalt bear a son and thou shalt call his name aishmael because the lord hath heard thy affliction

genesis whom hagar bore ishmael
abram was fourscore and six years old when hagar bore ishmael to abram and when abram was ninety years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him am god almighty walk before me and be thou wholehearted
i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee
abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying

i will bless her and moreover i will give thee a son of her yea i will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations kings of peoples shall be of
abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old and shall sarah that is ninety years old
abraham said unto god that ishmael might live before thee
god said but sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son b heb ab hamon
that is princess genesis and thou shalt call his name aisaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him
as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation
my covenant will i establish with isaac whom sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next
he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham
abraham took ishmael his son and all that were born in his house and all that were bought with his money every male among the men of house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day as god had said unto him
abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
the selfsame day was abraham circumcised and ishmael his son
all the men of his house those born in the house and those bought with money of a foreigner were circumcised with him
a and the lord appeared unto him by the terebinths of from the heb root meaning to laugh mamre as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day
he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood over against him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed down to the earth
said lord if now i have found favour in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant
now a little water be fetched and wash your feet and recline yourselves under the tree
i will fetch a morsel of bread and stay ye your heart after that ye shall pass on forasmuch as ye are come to your and they said do as thou hast
abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make
abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it unto the servant and he hastened to dress it
he took curd and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat
they said unto him is sarah thy and he said in the
he said will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round and lo sarah thy wife shall have a and sarah heard in the tent door which was behind
abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age it had ceased to be with sarah after the manner of
sarah laughed within
genesis herself saying i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old
the lord said unto abraham did sarah laugh saying shall i of a surety bear a child who am old
any thing too hard for the lord at the set time i will return unto thee when the season cometh round and sarah shall have a
sarah denied saying laughed for she was afraid and he said but thou didst
and the men rose up from thence and looked out toward sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way
the lord said i hide from abraham that which i am doing
that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him
i have known him to the end that he may command his children and his household after him that they may keep the way of the lord to do righteousness and justice to the end that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of
the lord said the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and verily their sin is exceeding grievous
will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not i will
the men turned from thence and went toward sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord
and abraham drew near and said thou indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked
peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city wilt thou indeed sweep away and not forgive the place for the fifty righteous that are therein
that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked that so the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do
the lord said i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city then i will forgive all the place for their
abraham answered and said now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord who am but dust and ashes
peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of and he said will not destroy it if i find there forty and
he spoke unto him yet again and said there shall be forty found and he said will not do it for the
he said let not the lord be angry and i will speak peradventure there shall thirty be found and he said will not do it if i find thirty
he said now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord peradventure there shall be twenty found and he said will not destroy it for the
he said let not the lord be angry and i will speak yet but this once peradventure ten shall be
genesis found and he said will not destroy it for the
the lord went his way as soon as he had left off speaking to abraham and abraham returned unto his place and the two angels came to sodom at even and lot sat in the gate of sodom and lot saw them and rose up to meet them and he fell down on his face to the earth
he said now my lords turn aside i pray you into your house and tarry all night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go on your and they said but we will abide in the broad place all
he urged them greatly and they turned in unto him and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eat
but before they lay down the men of the city even the men of sodom compassed the house round both young and old all the people from every quarter
they called unto lot and said unto him are the men that came in to thee this night bring them out unto us that we may know
lot went out unto them to the door and shut the door after him
he said pray you my brethren do not so wickedly
behold now i have two daughters that have not known man let me i pray you bring them out unto you and do ye to them as is good in your eyes only unto these men do nothing forasmuch as they are come under the
shadow of my
they said and they said one fellow came in to sojourn and he will needs play the judge now will we deal worse with thee than with and they pressed sore upon the man even lot and drew near to break the door
but the men put forth their hand and brought lot into the house to them and the door they shut
they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door
the men said unto lot thou here any besides soninlaw and thy sons and thy daughters and whomsoever thou hast in the city bring them out of the place
we will destroy this place because the cry of them is waxed great before the lord and the lord hath sent us to destroy
lot went out and spoke unto his sonsinlaw who married his daughters and said get you out of this place for the lord will destroy the but he seemed unto his sonsinlaw as one that jested
when the morning arose then the angels hastened lot saying take thy wife and thy two daughters that are here lest thou be swept away in the iniquity of the
he lingered and the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the lord being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without the city
and it came to pass when they had
genesis brought them forth abroad that he said for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be swept
lot said unto them not so my lord
now thy servant hath found grace in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy mercy which thou hast shown unto me in saving my life and i cannot escape to the mountain lest the evil overtake me and i die
now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little one oh let me escape it not a little my soul shall
he said unto him i have accepted thee concerning this thing also that i will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken
hasten thou escape thither for i cannot do any thing till thou be come the name of the city was called
sun was risen upon the earth when lot came unto zoar
the lord caused to rain upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven
he overthrow those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground
his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt
abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the lord
he looked out toward sodom and gomorrah and toward all a the land of the plain and beheld and lo the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace
and it came to pass when god destroyed the cities of the plain that god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which lot dwelt
and lot went up out of zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in zoar and he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters
the firstborn said unto the younger father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth
let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our
they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father and he knew not when she lay down nor when she arose
it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger i lay yesternight with my father let us make him drink wine this night also and go thou in and lie with him that we may preserve seed of our
they made their father drink wine that night also and the younger arose and lay with him and he knew not when she lay down nor when she arose
were both the daughters of lot with child by their father
the firstborn bore a son and called his name same that is little see verse
genesis is the father of the moabites unto this day
the younger she also bore a son and called his name same is the father of the children of ammon unto this day and abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the south and dwelt between kadesh and shur and he sojourned in gerar
abraham said of sarah his wife is my and abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah
god came to abimelech in a dream of the night and said to him thou shalt die because of the woman whom thou hast taken for she is a
abimelech had not come near her and he said wilt thou slay even a righteous nation
he not himself unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother in the simplicity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have i done
god said unto him in the dream i know that in the simplicity of thy heart thou hast done this and i also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered i thee not to touch her
therefore restore the wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are
and abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ears and the men were sore afraid
abimelech called abraham and said
unto him hast thou done unto us and wherein have i sinned against thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be
abimelech said unto abraham sawest thou that thou hast done this
abraham said i thought surely the fear of god is not in this place and they will slay me for my sake
moreover she is indeed my sister the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and so she became my wife
and it came to pass when god caused me to wander from my house that i said unto her this is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me at every place whither we shall come say of me he is my
and abimelech took sheep and oxen and menservants and womenservants and gave them unto abraham and restored him sarah his wife
abimelech said my land is before thee dwell where it pleaseth
unto sarah he said i have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver behold it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee and before all men thou art
abraham prayed unto god and god healed abimelech and his wife and his maidservants and they bore children
for the lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech because of sarah wife
genesis
and the lord remembered sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken
and sarah conceived and bore abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him
abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom sarah bore to him isaac
abraham circumcised his son isaac when he was eight days old as god had commanded him
abraham was a hundred years old when his son isaac was born unto him
sarah said hath made laughter for me every one that heareth will laugh on account of
she said would have said unto abraham that sarah should give children suck for i have borne him a son in his old
and the child grew and was weaned and abraham made a great feast on the day that isaac was weaned
sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian whom she had borne unto abraham making sport
wherefore she said unto abraham out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even with
the thing was very grievous in sight on account of his son
god said unto abraham it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman in all that sarah saith unto thee hearken unto her voice for in isaac shall seed be called to thee
also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation because he is thy
abraham arose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto hagar putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away and she departed and strayed in the wilderness of beersheba
the water in the bottle was spent and she cast the child under one of the shrubs
she went and sat her down over against him a good way off as it were a bowshot for she said me not look upon the death of the and she sat over against him and lifted up her voice and wept
god heard the voice of the lad and the angel of god called to hagar out of heaven and said unto her aileth thee hagar fear not for god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is
lift up the lad and hold him fast by thy hand for i will make him a great
and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink
god was with the lad and he grew and he dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer
and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran and his mother took him a wife out of the land of egypt
and it came to pass at that time that abimelech and phicol the captain of his host spoke unto abraham saying is with thee in all that thou doest
therefore swear unto me here by god that thou wilt not deal
genesis falsely with me nor with my son nor with my son but according to the kindness that i have done unto thee thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast
and abraham said will
and abraham reproved abimelech because of the well of water which servants had violently taken away
abimelech said know not who hath done this thing neither didst thou tell me neither yet heard i of it but
abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto abimelech and they two made a covenant
abraham set seven ewelambs of the flock by themselves
abimelech said unto abraham mean these seven ewelambs which thou hast set by
he said these seven ewelambs shalt thou take of my hand that it may be a witness unto me that i have digged this
that place was called beersheba because there they swore both of them
they made a covenant at beersheba and abimelech rose up and phicol the captain of his host and they returned into the land of the philistines
abraham planted a tamarisktree in beersheba and called there on the name of the lord the everlasting god
abraham sojourned in the land of the philistines many days and it came to pass after these things that god did prove abraham and said unto him
and he said am
and he said now thy son thine only son whom thou lovest even isaac and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burntoffering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee
and abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and he cleaved the wood for the burntoffering and rose up and went unto the place of which god had told him
the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off
abraham said unto his young men ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and we will worship and come back to
abraham took the wood of the burntoffering and laid it upon isaac his son and he took in his hand the fire and the knife and they went both of them together
isaac spoke unto abraham his father and said and he said am i my and he said the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a
abraham said will aprovide himself the lamb for a burntoffering my so they went both of them together
they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the a
heb jireh that is see for himself genesis wood
abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son
the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said and he said am
he said not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou any thing unto him for now i know that thou art a godfearing man seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from
abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burntoffering in the stead of his son
abraham called the name of that place aadonaijireh as it is said to this day the mount where the lord is
the angel of the lord called unto abraham a second time out of heaven
said myself have i sworn saith the lord because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only son
in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies
in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast hearkened to my
abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went together to beer a that is the lord seeth sheba and abraham dwelt at beersheba
and it came to pass after these things that it was told abraham saying milcah she also hath borne children unto thy brother nahor
uz his firstborn and buz his brother and kemuel the father of aram

and the life of sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years these were the years of the life of sarah
sarah died in same is the land of canaan and abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her
abraham rose up from before his dead and spoke unto the children of heth saying

the children of heth answered abraham saying unto him
us my lord thou art a mighty prince among us in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre but that thou mayest bury thy
and abraham rose up and bowed down to the people of the land even to
genesis the children of heth
he spoke with them saying it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and entreat for me to ephron the son of zohar
he may give me the cave of machpelah which he hath which is in the end of his field for the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a possession of a
ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of heth and ephron the hittite answered abraham in the hearing of the children of heth even of all that went in at the gate of his city saying
my lord hear me the field give i thee and the cave that is therein i give it thee in the presence of the sons of my people give i it thee bury thy
abraham bowed down before the people of the land
he spoke unto ephron in the hearing of the people of the land saying if thou wilt i pray thee hear me i will give the price of the field take it of me and i will bury my dead
ephron answered abraham saying unto him
lord hearken unto me a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver what is that betwixt me and thee bury therefore thy
and abraham hearkened unto ephron and abraham weighed to ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the children of heth four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchant
the field of ephron which was in machpelah which was before mamre the field and the cave which was therein and all the trees that were in the field that were in all the border thereof round about were made sure

i will make thee swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i dwell
thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife for my son even for
the servant said unto him the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must i needs bring thy son back unto the land from whence thou
abraham said unto him thou that thou bring not my son back thither
lord the god of heaven who took me from my
genesis house and from the land of my nativity and who spoke unto me and who swore unto me saying unto thy seed will i give this land he will send his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence
if the woman be not willing to follow thee then thou shalt be clear from this my oath only thou shalt not bring my son back
and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter
and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed having all goodly things of his in his hand and he arose and went to aaramnaharaim unto the city of nahor
he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of evening the time that women go out to draw water
he said lord the god of my master abraham send me i pray thee good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham
i stand by the fountain of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water
let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy pitcher i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant even for isaac and thereby shall i know that thou hast a shown kindness unto my
and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebekah came out who was born to bethuel the son of milcah the wife of nahor brother with her pitcher upon her shoulder
the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the fountain and filled her pitcher and came up
the servant ran to meet her and said me to drink i pray thee a little water of thy
she said my and she hastened and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink
when she had done giving him drink she said will draw for thy camels also until they have done
she hastened and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again unto the well to draw and drew for all his camels
the man looked stedfastly on her holding his peace to know whether the lord had made his journey prosperous or not
it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold
said daughter art thou tell me i pray thee is there room in thy house for us to lodge
she said unto him am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah whom she bore unto
said moreover unto him have both straw and provender that is mesopotamia
genesis enough and room to lodge
the man bowed his head and prostrated himself before the lord
and he said be the lord the god of my master abraham who hath not forsaken his mercy and his truth toward my master as for me the lord hath led me in the way to the house of my
the damsel ran and told her house according to these words
rebekah had a brother and his name was laban and laban ran out unto the man unto the fountain
it came to pass when he saw the ring and the bracelets upon his hands and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister saying spoke the man unto me he came unto the man and behold he stood by the camels at the fountain
he said in thou blessed of the lord wherefore standest thou without for i have cleared the house and made room for the
the man came into the house and he ungirded the camels and he gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that were with him
there was set food before him to eat but he said will not eat until i have told mine and he said
he said am servant
the lord hath blessed my master greatly and he is become great and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and menservants and maidservants and camels and asses
sarah my wife bore a son to my master when she was old and unto him hath he given all that he hath
and my master made me swear saying thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i dwell
but thou shalt go unto my house and to my kindred and take a wife for my son
i said unto my master peradventure the woman will not follow me
he said unto me the lord before whom i walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred and of my house
shalt thou be clear from my oath when thou comest to my kindred and if they give her not to thee thou shalt be clear from my oath
i came this day unto the fountain and said o lord the god of my master abraham if now thou do prosper my way which i go
i stand by the fountain of water and let it come to pass that the maiden that cometh forth to draw to whom i shall say give me i pray thee a little water from thy pitcher to drink
she shall say to me both drink thou and i will also draw for thy camels let the same be the woman whom the lord hath appointed for my son
and before i had done speaking to my heart behold rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder and she went down unto the fountain and drew and i said unto her let me drink i pray thee
she made
genesis haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder and said drink and i will give thy camels drink also so i drank and she made the camels drink also
i asked her and said whose daughter art thou and she said the daughter of bethuel son whom milcah bore unto him and i put the ring upon her nose and the bracelets upon her hands
i bowed my head and prostrated myself before the lord and blessed the lord the god of my master abraham who had led me in the right way to take my daughter for his son
now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master tell me and if not tell me that i may turn to the right hand or to the
laban and bethuel answered and said thing proceedeth from the lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or good
rebekah is before thee take her and go and let her be thy wife as the lord hath
it came to pass that when servant heard their words he bowed himself down to the earth unto the lord
the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and gave them to rebekah he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things
they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and tarried all night and they rose up in the morning and he said me away unto my
her brother and her mother said the damsel abide with us a few days at the least ten after that she shall
he said unto them me not seeing the lord hath prospered my way send me away that i may go to my
they said will call the damsel and inquire at her
they called rebekah and said unto her thou go with this and she said will
and they sent away rebekah their sister and her nurse and servant and his men
they blessed rebekah and said unto her sister be thou the mother of thousands of ten thousands and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate
rebekah arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man and the servant took rebekah and went his way
isaac came from the way of beerlahairoi for he dwelt in the land of the south
isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold there were camels coming
rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she alighted from the camel
she said unto the servant man is this that walketh in the field to meet and the servant said is my and she took her veil and covered herself
the servant told isaac all the things that he had done
and isaac brought her into his mother tent and took rebekah and she became his wife
genesis and he loved her and isaac was comforted for his mother and abraham took another wife and her name was keturah
she bore him zimran and jokshan and medan and midian and ishbak and shuah
jokshan begot sheba and dedan and the sons of dedan were asshurim and letushim and leummim
the sons of midian ephah and epher and hanoch and abida and eldaah all these were the children of keturah
and abraham gave all that he had unto isaac
unto the sons of the concubines that abraham had abraham gave gifts and he sent them away from isaac his son while he yet lived eastward unto the east country
and these are the days of the years of life which he lived a hundred threescore and fifteen years
and abraham expired and died in a good old age an old man and full of years and was gathered to his people
and isaac and ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of machpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite which is before mamre
field which abraham purchased of the children of heth there was abraham buried and sarah his wife
it came to pass after the death of abraham that god blessed isaac his son and isaac dwelt by beerlahairoi
now these are the generations of ishmael son whom hagar the egyptian handmaid bore unto abraham
these are the
names of the sons of ishmael by their names according to their generations the firstborn of ishmael nebaioth and kedar and adbeel and mibsam
and mishma and dumah and massa
and tema jetur naphish and kedem
are the sons of ishmael and these are their names by their villages and by their encampments twelve princes
according to their nations and these are the years of the life of ishmael a hundred and thirty and seven years and he expired and died and was gathered unto his people
they dwelt from havilah unto shur that is before egypt as thou goest toward asshur over against all his brethren he did settle
and these are the generations of isaac son abraham begot isaac
isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah the daughter of bethuel the aramean of paddanaram the sister of laban the aramean to be his wife
isaac entreated the lord for his wife because she was barren and the lord let himself be entreated of him and rebekah his wife
conceived and the children struggled together within her and she said it be so wherefore do i and she went to inquire of the lord
and the lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels
genesis and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger
and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb
the first came forth ruddy all over like a hairy mantle and they called his name esau
and after that came forth his brother and his hand had hold on heel and his name was called ajacob and isaac was threescore years old when she bore them
the boys grew and esau was a cunning hunter a man of the field and jacob was a quiet man dwelling in tents
isaac loved esau because he did eat of his venison and rebekah loved jacob
and jacob sod pottage and esau came in from the field and he was faint
esau said to jacob me swallow i pray thee some of this red red pottage for i am therefore was his name called bedom
and jacob said me first thy birth
esau said i am at the point to die and what profit shall the birthright do to
jacob said to me and he swore unto him and he sold his birthright unto jacob
jacob gave esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat and drink and rose up a that is one that takes by the heel or supplants b that is red and went his way so esau despised his birthright and there was a famine in the land beside the first famine that was in the days of abraham and isaac went unto abimelech king of the philistines unto gerar
the lord appeared unto him and said not down unto egypt dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of
in this land and i will be with thee and will bless thee for unto thee and unto thy seed i will give all these lands and i will establish the oath which i swore unto abraham thy father
i will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed all these lands and by thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves
that abraham hearkened to my voice and kept my charge my commandments my statutes and my
isaac dwelt in gerar
the men of the place asked him of his wife and he said is my for he feared to say the men of the place should kill me for rebekah because she is fair to look
it came to pass when he had been there a long time that abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window and saw and behold isaac was sporting with rebekah his wife
and abimelech called isaac and said of a surety she is thy wife and how saidst thou she is my and isaac said unto him i said lest i die because of
genesis abimelech said is this thou hast done unto us one of the people might easily have lain with thy wife and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon
abimelech charged all the people saying that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to
isaac sowed in that land and found in the same year a hundredfold and the lord blessed him
the man waxed great and grew more and more until he became very great
he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great household and the philistines envied him
all the wells which his servants had digged in the days of abraham his father the philistines had stopped them and filled them with earth
abimelech said unto isaac from us for thou art much mightier than
isaac departed thence and encamped in the valley of gerar and dwelt there
isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of abraham his father for the philistines had stopped them after the death of abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them
and servants digged in the valley and found there a well of living water
the herdmen of gerar strove with herdmen saying water is and he called the name of the well aesek because they contended with him
they digged another well and they strove for that also and he called the name of it bsitnah
he removed from thence and digged another well and for that they strove not and he called the name of it crehoboth and he said now the lord hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the
he went up from thence to beersheba
the lord appeared unto him the same night and said am the god of abraham thy father fear not for i am with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant
he builded an altar there and called upon the name of the lord and pitched his tent there and there servants digged a well
abimelech went to him from gerar and ahuzzath his friend and phicol the captain of his host
isaac said unto them are ye come unto me seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from
they said saw plainly that the lord was with thee and we said let there now be an oath betwixt us even betwixt us and thee and let us make a covenant with thee
thou wilt do us no hurt as we have not touched thee and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and have sent thee away in peace thou a that is contention that is enmity c that is room b
genesis art now the blessed of the
and he made them a feast and they did eat and drink
they rose up betimes in the morning and swore one to another and isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace
and it came to pass the same day that servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged and said unto him have found
he called it shibah therefore the name of the city is beersheba unto this day
and when esau was forty years old he took to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite and basemath the daughter of elon the hittite
they were a bitterness of spirit unto isaac and to rebekah and it came to pass that when isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called esau his elder son and said unto him and he said unto him am
he said now i am old i know not the day of my death
therefore take i pray thee thy weapons thy quiver and thy bow and go out to the field and take me venison
make me savoury food such as i love and bring it to me that i may eat that my soul may bless thee before i
rebekah heard when isaac spoke to esau his son and esau went to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it
rebekah spoke unto jacob her son saying i heard thy father speak unto esau thy brother saying
bring me venison and make me savoury food that i may eat and bless thee before the lord before my death
now therefore my son hearken to my voice according to that which i command thee
now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats and i will make them savoury food for thy father such as he loveth
thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may eat so that he may bless thee before his
jacob said to rebekah his mother esau my brother is a hairy man and i am a smooth man
father peradventure will feel me and i shall seem to him as a mocker and i shall bring a curse upon me and not a
his mother said unto him me be thy curse my son only hearken to my voice and go fetch me
he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and his mother made savoury food such as his father loved
rebekah took the choicest garments of esau her elder son which were with her in the house and put them upon jacob her younger son
she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck
and she gave the savoury food and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob
he came unto his father and said and he said am i who art thou my
jacob said unto his father am esau thy firstborn i have done according as thou
genesis badest me arise i pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may bless
isaac said unto his son is it that thou hast found it so quickly my and he said the lord thy god sent me good
isaac said unto jacob near i pray thee that i may feel thee my son whether thou be my very son esau or
jacob went near unto isaac his father and he felt him and said voice is the voice of jacob but the hands are the hands of
he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his brother hands so he blessed him
he said thou my very son and he said
he said it near to me and i will eat of my venison that my soul may bless and he brought it near to him and he did eat and he brought him wine and he drank
his father isaac said unto him near now and kiss me my
he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the lord hath blessed
so god give thee of the dew of heaven and of the fat places of the earth and plenty of corn and wine
let peoples serve thee and nations bow down to thee be lord over thy brethren and let thy sons bow down to thee cursed be every one that curseth thee and blessed be every one that blesseth thee
and it came to pass as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting
he also made savoury food and brought it unto his father and he said unto his father my father arise and eat of his venison that thy soul may bless
and isaac his father said unto him art and he said am thy son thy firstborn
isaac trembled very exceedingly and said then is he that hath taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of all before thou camest and have blessed him yea and he shall be
esau heard the words of his father he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry and said unto his father me even me also o my
he said brother came with guile and hath taken away thy
he said not he rightly named jacob for he hath supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright and behold now he hath taken away my and he said thou not reserved a blessing for
isaac answered and said unto esau i have made him thy lord
genesis and all his brethren have i given to him for servants and with corn and wine have i sustained him and what then shall i do for thee my
and esau said unto his father thou but one blessing my father bless me even me also o my and esau lifted up his voice and wept
and isaac his father answered and said unto him behold of the fat places of the earth shall be thy dwelling and of the dew of heaven from above
and by thy sword shalt thou live and thou shalt serve thy brother and it shall come to pass when thou shalt break loose that thou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck
and esau hated jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him and esau said in his heart the days of mourning for my father be at hand then will i slay my brother
the words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah and she sent and called jacob her younger son and said unto him thy brother esau as touching thee doth comfort himself purposing to kill thee
now therefore my son hearken to my voice and arise flee thou to laban my brother to haran
tarry with him a few days until thy fury turn away
thy anger turn away from thee and he forget that which thou hast done to him then i will send and fetch thee from thence why should i be bereaved of you both in one
and rebekah said to isaac am weary of my life because of the daughters of heth if jacob take a wife of the daughters of heth such as these of the daughters of the land what good shall my life do and isaac called jacob and blessed him and charged him and said unto him shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan
arise go to paddanaram to the house of bethuel thy father and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of laban thy brother
god almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee that thou mayest be a congregation of peoples
give thee the blessing of abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee that thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings which god gave unto
isaac sent away jacob and he went to paddanaram unto laban son of bethuel the aramean the brother of rebekah and mother
esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and sent him away to paddanaram to take him a wife from thence and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge saying shalt not take a wife of the daughters of
that jacob hearkened to his father and his mother and was gone to paddanaram
and esau saw that the daughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father
genesis
so esau went unto ishmael and took unto the wives that he had mahalath the daughter of ishmael son the sister of nebaioth to be his wife
and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran
he lighted upon the place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep
and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it
behold the lord stood beside him and said am the lord the god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed
thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed
behold i am with thee and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest and will bring thee back into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to thee
jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said the lord is in this place and i knew it
and he was afraid and said full of awe is this place this is none other than the house of god and this is the gate of
jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it
he called the name of that place abethel but the name of the city was luz at the first
and jacob vowed a vow saying god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on
so that i come back to my house in peace then shall the lord be my god
this stone which i have set up for a pillar shall be house and of all that thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto then jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the children of the east
he looked and behold a well in the field and lo three flocks of sheep lying there by out of that well they watered the flocks and the stone upon the mouth was great
thither were all the flocks gathered and they rolled the stone from the mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone back upon the mouth in its
jacob said unto them brethren whence are and they said haran are
and he said unto them ye laban the son of and they said know
he said unto them it well with and
a
that is the house of god genesis they said is well and behold rachel his daughter cometh with the
he said it is yet high day neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together water ye the sheep and go and feed
and they said cannot until all the flocks be gathered together and they roll the stone from the mouth then we water the
while he was yet speaking with them rachel came with her sheep for she tended them
it came to pass when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his brother and the sheep of laban his brother that jacob went near and rolled the stone from the mouth and watered the flock of laban his brother
jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept
jacob told rachel that he was her brother and that he was son and she ran and told her father
it came to pass when laban heard the tidings of jacob his son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house and he told laban all these things
and laban said to him thou art my bone and my and he abode with him the space of a month
and laban said unto jacob thou art my brother shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought tell me what shall thy wages
laban had two daughters the name of the elder was leah and the name of the younger was rachel
and eyes were weak but rachel was of beautiful form and fair to look upon
jacob loved rachel and he said will serve thee seven years for rachel thy younger
laban said is better that i give her to thee than that i should give her to another man abide with
jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her
jacob said unto laban me my wife for my days are filled that i may go in unto
and laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast
and it came to pass in the evening that he took leah his daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her
laban gave zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter leah for a handmaid
it came to pass in the morning that behold it was leah and he said to laban is this thou hast done unto me did not i serve with thee for rachel wherefore then hast thou beguiled
laban said is not so done in our place to give the younger before the firstborn
fulfil the week of this one and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other
jacob did so and fulfilled her week and he gave him rachel his daughter to wife
laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid
he went in also unto
genesis rachel and he loved rachel more than leah and served with him yet seven other years
and the lord saw that leah was hated and he opened her womb but rachel was barren
leah conceived and bore a son and she called his name reuben for she said the lord ahath looked upon my affliction for now my husband will love
she conceived again and bore a son and said the lord bhath heard that i am hated he hath therefore given me this son and she called his name c simeon
she conceived again and bore a son and said this time will my husband be djoined unto me because i have borne him three therefore was his name called levi
she conceived again and bore a son and she said time will i epraise the therefore she called his name fjudah and she left off bearing and when rachel saw that she bore jacob no children rachel envied her sister and she said unto jacob me children or else i
anger was kindled against rachel and he said i in stead who hath withheld from
a thee the fruit of the
she said my maid bilhah go in unto her that she may bear upon my knees and i also may be builded up through
she gave him bilhah her handmaid to wife and jacob went in unto her
bilhah conceived and bore jacob a son
rachel said hath gjudged me and hath also heard my voice and hath given me a therefore called she his name dan
bilhah handmaid conceived again and bore jacob a second son
rachel said mighty wrestlings have i h wrestled with my sister and have and she called his name naphtali
leah saw that she had left off bearing she took zilpah her handmaid and gave her to jacob to wife
zilpah handmaid bore jacob a son
leah said is come and she called his name igad
zilpah handmaid bore jacob a second son
and leah said am i for the daughters will call me and she called his name jasher
reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them unto his mother leah then rachel said to leah me i pray thee of thy
and she said unto her it a small heb raah beonji heb shama c heb shimeon d from the heb root lavah e from the heb hodah f heb jehudah b g heb dan he judged heb niphtal he wrestled i that is fortune j that is happy h
genesis matter that thou hast taken away my husband and wouldest thou take away my mandrakes and rachel said he shall lie with thee tonight for thy
jacob came from the field in the evening and leah went out to meet him and said must come in unto me for i have surely hired thee with my and he lay with her that night
god hearkened unto leah and she conceived and bore jacob a fifth son
and leah said hath given me my ahire because i gave my handmaid to my husband and she called his name issachar
leah conceived again and bore a sixth son to jacob
and leah said hath endowed me with a good dowry now will my husband bdwell with me because i have borne him six and she called his name zebulun
afterwards she bore a daughter and called her name dinah
god remembered rachel and god hearkened to her and opened her womb
she conceived and bore a son and said chath taken away my
she called his name joseph saying lord dadd to me another
and it came to pass when rachel had borne joseph that jacob said unto a heb sachar heb sabal he dwelt c heb asaph d heb joseph b laban me away that i may go unto mine own place and to my country
me my wives and my children for whom i have served thee and let me go for thou knowest my service wherewith i have served
and laban said unto him now i have found favour in thine have observed the signs and the lord hath blessed me for thy
he said me thy wages and i will give
he said unto him knowest how i have served thee and how thy cattle have fared with me
it was little which thou hadst before i came and it hath increased abundantly and the lord hath blessed thee whithersoever i turned and now when shall i provide for mine own house
he said shall i give and jacob said shalt not give me aught if thou wilt do this thing for me i will again feed thy flock and keep it
i will pass through all thy flock today removing from thence every speckled and spotted one and every dark one among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats and of such shall be my hire
shall my righteousness witness against me hereafter when thou shalt come to look over my hire that is before thee every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and dark among the sheep that if found with me shall be counted
laban said would it might be according to thy
he
genesis removed that day the hegoats that were streaked and spotted and all the shegoats that were speckled and spotted every one that had white in it and all the dark ones among the sheep and gave them into the hand of his sons
he set three betwixt himself and jacob and jacob fed the rest of flocks
jacob took him rods of fresh poplar and of the almond and of the planetree and peeled white streaks in them making the white appear which was in the rods
he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the wateringtroughs where the flocks came to drink and they conceived when they came to drink
the flocks conceived at the sight of the rods and the flocks brought forth streaked speckled and spotted
jacob separated the also set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the dark in the flock of and put his own droves apart and put them not unto flock
it came to pass whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters that they might conceive among the rods
when the flock were feeble he put them not in so the feebler were and the stronger
the man increased exceedingly and had large flocks and maidservants and menservants and camels and asses and he heard the words of
sons saying hath taken away all that was our and of that which was our hath he gotten all this
jacob beheld the countenance of laban and behold it was not toward him as beforetime
the lord said unto jacob unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred and i will be with
jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his flock
said unto them see your countenance that it is not toward me as beforetime but the god of my father hath been with me
and ye know that with all my power i have served your father
your father hath mocked me and changed my wages ten times but god suffered him not to hurt me
he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the flock bore speckled and if he said thus the streaked shall be thy wages then bore all the flock streaked
thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father and given them to me
and it came to pass at the time that the flock conceived that i lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the hegoats which leaped upon the flock were streaked speckled and grizzled
the angel of god said unto me in the dream jacob and i said here am i
he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the hegoats which leap upon the flock are streaked speckled and grizzled for i have seen all that laban doeth unto thee
am the god of
genesis bethel where thou didst anoint a pillar where thou didst vow a vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land and return unto the land of thy
rachel and leah answered and said unto him there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our house
we not accounted by him strangers for he hath sold us and hath also quite devoured our price

laban came up with jacob now jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain and laban with his brethren pitched in the mountain of gilead
laban said to jacob hast thou done that thou hast outwitted me and carried away my daughters as though captives of the sword
didst thou flee secretly and outwit me and didst not tell me that i might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs with tabret and with harp
didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters now hast thou done foolishly
is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the god of your father spoke unto me yesternight saying take heed to thyself that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad
and now that thou art surely gone because thou sore longest after thy house wherefore hast thou stolen my
jacob answered and said to laban i was afraid for i said lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force
whomsoever thou findest thy gods he shall not live before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me and take it to for jacob knew not that rachel had stolen

whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff what hast thou found of all thy household stuff set it here before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge betwixt us two
twenty years have i been with thee thy ewes and thy shegoats have not cast their young and the rams of thy flocks have i not eaten
which was torn of beasts i brought not unto thee i bore the loss of it of my hand didst thou require it whether stolen by day or stolen by night
i was in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep fled from mine eyes
twenty years have i been in thy house i served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy flock and thou hast changed my wages ten times
except the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had been on my side surely now hadst thou sent me away empty god hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands and gave judgment
laban answered and said unto jacob daughters are my daughters and the children are my children and the flocks are my flocks and all that thou seest is mine and what can i do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne
and now come let us make a covenant i and thou and let it be for a witness between me and

jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed and he divided the people that was with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two camps
he said esau come to the one camp and smite it then the camp which is left shall
jacob said god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac o lord who saidst unto me return unto thy country and to thy kindred and i will do thee good
i am not worthy of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast shown unto thy servant for with my staff i passed over this jordan and now i am become two camps
deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he come and smite me the mother with the children
thou saidst i will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for

he commanded the foremost saying that is two camps
genesis esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee saying whose art thou and whither goest thou and whose are these before thee
thou shalt say they are thy servant it is a present sent unto my lord even unto esau and behold he also is behind

and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of thigh was strained as he wrestled with him
he said me go for the day and he said will not let thee go except thou bless
and he said unto him is thy and be said
he said name shall be called no more jacob but aisrael for thou hast striven with god and with men and hast

and esau said have enough my brother let that which thou hast be
jacob said i pray thee if now i have found favour in thy sight then receive my present at my hand forasmuch as i have seen thy face as one seeth the face of god and thou wast pleased with me
i pray thee my gift that is brought to thee because god hath dealt graciously with me and because i have and he urged him and he took it
he said us take our journey and let us go and i will go before
he said unto him lord knoweth that the children are tender and that the flocks and herds giving suck are a care to me and if they overdrive them one day all the flocks will die
my lord i pray thee pass over before his servant and i will journey on gently according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children until i come unto my lord unto

the sons of jacob came in from the field when they heard it and the men were grieved and they were very wroth because he had wrought a vile deed in israel in lying with daughter which thing ought not to be done

make ye marriages with us give your daughters unto us and take our daughters unto you
ye shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you dwell and trade ye therein and get you possessions

me never so much dowry and gift and i will give according as ye shall say unto me but give me the damsel to
the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father with guile and spoke because he had defiled dinah their sister
said unto them cannot do this thing to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised for that were a reproach unto us
on this condition will we consent unto you if ye will be as we are that every male of you be circumcised
will we give our daughters unto you and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and we will become one people
if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised then will we take our daughter and we will be

the young man deferred not to do the thing because he had delight in daughter and he was honoured above all the house of his father

israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colours
when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him
joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to his brethren and they hated him yet the more
he said unto them i pray you this dream which i have dreamed
behold we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves came round about and bowed down to my
his brethren said to him thou indeed reign over us or shalt thou indeed have dominion over and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words
he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brethren and said i have dreamed yet a dream and behold the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to
he told it to his father and to his brethren and his father rebuked him and said unto him is this dream that thou hast dreamed shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down to thee to the
his brethren envied him but his father kept the saying in mind

and his brethren went to feed their flock in shechem
israel said unto joseph not thy brethren feed the flock in shechem come and i will send thee unto and he said to him am
he said to him now see whether it is well with thy brethren and well with the flock and bring me back so he sent him out of the vale of hebron and he came to shechem
a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field and the man asked him saying seekest
he said seek my brethren tell me i pray thee where they are feeding the
the man said are departed hence for i heard them say let us go to and joseph went after his brethren and found them in dothan
and they saw him afar off and before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay him
and they said one to another this dreamer cometh
now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into one of the pits and we will say an evil beast hath devoured him and we shall see what will become of his
reuben heard it and delivered him out of their hand and said us not take his
reuben said unto them no blood cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness but lay no hand upon he might deliver him out of their hand to restore him to his father
it came to pass when joseph was come unto his brethren that they stripped joseph of his coat the coat of many colours that was on him
they took him and cast him into the the pit was empty there was no water in it
they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a caravan of ishmaelites came from gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and ladanum going to carry it down to egypt
judah said unto his brethren profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood
and let us sell him to the ishmaelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother our and his brethren hearkened unto him
there passed by midianites merchantmen and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver and they brought joseph into egypt
reuben returned unto the pit and behold joseph was not in the pit and he rent his clothes
he returned unto his brethren and said child is not and as for me whither shall i
they took coat and killed a hegoat and dipped the coat in the blood

judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was shua and he took her and went in unto her
she conceived and bore a son and he called his name er
she conceived again and bore a son and she called his name onan
she yet again bore a son and called his name shelah and he was at chezib when she bore him
and judah took a wife for er his firstborn and her name was tamar
er firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord and the lord slew him

onan knew that the seed would not be his and it came to pass when he went in unto his wife that he spilled it on the
a ground lest he should give seed to his brother
the thing which he did was evil in the sight of the lord and he slew him also
said judah to tamar his daughterinlaw a widow in thy house till shelah my son be grown for he said he also die like his and tamar went and dwelt in her house
in process of time daughter the wife of judah died and judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers to timnah he and his friend hirah the adullamite
it was told tamar saying thy fatherinlaw goeth up to timnah to shear his
she put off from her the garments of her widowhood and covered herself with her veil and wrapped herself and sat in the entrance of enaim which is by the way to timnah for she saw that shelah was grown up and she was not given unto him to wife
judah saw her he thought her to be a harlot for she had covered her face
he turned unto her by the way and said i pray thee let me come in unto for he knew not that she was his daughterinlaw and she said wilt thou give me that thou mayest come in unto
he said will send thee a kid of the goats from the and she said thou give me a pledge till thou send
he said pledge shall i give and she said signet and thy cord and thy staff that heb medanites
genesis is in thy and he gave them to her and came in unto her and she conceived by him
she arose and went away and put off her veil from her and put on the garments of her widowhood
judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the adullamite to receive the pledge from the hand but he found her not
he asked the men of her place saying is the harlot that was at enaim by the and they said hath been no harlot
he returned to judah and said have not found her and also the men of the place said there hath been no harlot
judah said her take it lest we be put to shame behold i sent this kid and thou hast not found
it came to pass about three months after that it was told judah saying thy daughterinlaw hath played the harlot and moreover behold she is with child by and judah said her forth and let her be
she was brought forth she sent to her fatherinlaw saying the man whose these are am i with and she said i pray thee whose are these the signet and the cords and the
judah acknowledged them and said is more righteous than i forasmuch as i gave her not to shelah my and he knew her again no more

master took him and put him into the prison the place where the prisoners were bound and he was there in the prison
but the lord was with joseph and showed kindness unto him and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison
the keeper of the prison committed to hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it

joseph came in unto them in the morning and saw them and behold they were sad
he asked officers that were with him in the ward of his house saying look ye so sad
they said unto him have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret and joseph said unto them not interpretations belong to god tell it me i pray
and the chief butler told his dream to joseph and said to him my dream behold a vine was before me
in the vine were three branches and as it was budding its blossoms shot forth and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes
cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and pressed them into cup and i gave the cup into
and joseph said unto him is the interpretation of it the three branches are three days
yet three days shall pharaoh lift up thy head and restore thee unto thine office and thou shalt give cup into his hand after the former manner when thou wast his butler
but have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee and show kindness i pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto pharaoh and bring me out of this house
indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews and here also have i done nothing that they should put me into the
when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he said unto joseph also saw in my dream and behold three baskets of white bread were on my head
in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for pharaoh and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my
joseph answered and said is the interpretation thereof the three baskets are three days
yet three days shall pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee and shall hang thee on a tree and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off
it came to pass the third day which was birthday that he made a feast unto all his servants and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants
he restored the chief butler back unto his butlership and he gave the cup into hand
he hanged the chief baker as joseph had interpreted to them
did not the chief butler remember joseph but forgot him
and it came to pass at the end of two full years that pharaoh genesis dreamed and behold he stood by the a river
behold there came up out of the river seven kine wellfavoured and fatfleshed and they fed in the reedgrass
behold seven other kine came up after them out of the river ill favoured and leanfleshed and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river
the illfavoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven wellfavoured and fat kine so pharaoh awoke
he slept and dreamed a second time and behold seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk rank and good
behold seven ears thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them
the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears and pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream
it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt and all the wise men thereof and pharaoh told them his dream but there was none that could interpret them unto pharaoh
then spoke the chief butler unto pharaoh saying make mention of my faults this day
was wroth with his servants and put me in the ward of the house of the captain of the guard me and the chief baker
and we dreamed a dream in one night i and he we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream
there was with us there a a young man a hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret
it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was i was restored unto mine office and he was
pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his raiment and came in unto pharaoh
and pharaoh said unto joseph have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it and i have heard say of thee that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret
and joseph answered pharaoh saying is not in me god will give pharaoh an answer of
pharaoh spoke unto joseph my dream behold i stood upon the brink of the river
behold there came up out of the river seven kine fatfleshed and wellfavoured and they fed in the reedgrass
behold seven other kine came up after them poor and very illfavoured and leanfleshed such as i never saw in all the land of egypt for badness
the lean and illfavoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine
when they had eaten them up it could not be known that they had eaten them but they were still illfavoured as at the beginning so i awoke
i saw in my dream and behold seven ears came up upon one stalk full and good
and behold seven ears withered that is the nile
genesis thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them
the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears and i told it unto the magicians but there was none that could declare it to
joseph said unto pharaoh dream of pharaoh is one what god is about to do he hath declared unto pharaoh
seven good kine are seven years and the seven good ears are seven years the dream is one
the seven lean and illfavoured kine that came up after them are seven years and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind they shall be seven years of famine
is the thing which i spoke unto pharaoh what god is about to do he hath shown unto pharaoh
there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt
there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt and the famine shall consume the land
the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth for it shall be very grievous
for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass
therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of egypt
pharaoh do this and let him appoint overseers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven years of plenty
let them gather all the food of these good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh for food in the cities and let them keep it
the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the land perish not through the
the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants
pharaoh said unto his servants we find such a one as this a man in whom the spirit of god
pharaoh said unto joseph as god hath shown thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as thou
thou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will i be greater than
pharaoh said unto joseph i have set thee over all the land of
pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it upon hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck
he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him and he set him over all the land of egypt
and pharaoh said unto joseph am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of
pharaoh called name zaphenathpaneah and he gave him to wife asenath the daughter of potiphera priest of on and joseph went out
genesis over the land of
joseph was thirty years old when he stood before pharaoh king of joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of egypt
in the seven years of plenty the earth brought forth in heaps
he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was round about every city laid he up in the same
joseph laid up corn as the sand of the sea very much until they left off numbering for it was without number
unto joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came whom asenath the daughter of potiphera priest of on bore unto him
joseph called the name of the firstborn amanasseh god hath made me forget all my toil and all my
the name of the second called he b ephraim god hath made me fruitful in the land of my
and the seven years of plenty that was in the land of egypt came to an end
the seven years of famine began to come according as joseph had said and there was famine in all lands but in all the land of egypt there was bread
when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said a that is making to forget from a hebrew word signifying to be fruitful b unto all the egyptians unto joseph what he saith to you
and the famine was over all the face of the earth and joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the egyptians and the famine was sore in the land of egypt
all countries came into egypt to joseph to buy corn because the famine was sore in all the earth now jacob saw that there was corn in egypt and jacob said unto his sons do ye look one upon
he said i have heard that there is corn in egypt get you down thither and buy for us from thence that we may live and not
ten brethren went down to buy corn from egypt
benjamin brother jacob sent not with his brethren for he said peradventure harm befall
the sons of israel came to buy among those that came for the famine was in the land of caanan
joseph was the governor over the land he it was that sold to all the people of the land and brethren came and bowed down to him with their faces to the earth
joseph saw his brethren and he knew them but made himself strange unto them and spoke roughly with them and he said unto them come and they said the land of canaan to buy
joseph knew his brethren but they knew him not
joseph remembered the dreams which he
genesis dreamed of them and said unto them are spies to see the nakedness of the land ye are
they said unto him my lord but to buy food are thy servants come
are all one sons we are upright men thy servants are no
he said unto them but to see the nakedness of the land ye are
and they said thy servants are twelve brethren the sons of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is
joseph said unto them is it that i spoke unto you saying ye are spies
ye shall be proved as pharaoh liveth ye shall not go forth hence except your youngest brother come hither
one of you and let him fetch your brother and ye shall be bound that your words may be proved whether there be truth in you or else as pharaoh liveth surely ye are
and he put them all together into ward three days
joseph said unto them the third this do and live for i fear god
ye be upright men let one of your brethren be bound in your prisonhouse but go ye carry corn for the famine of your houses
and bring your youngest brother unto me so shall your words be verified and ye shall not and they did so
and they said one to another are verily guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the distress of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon
reuben answered them saying i not unto you saying do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore also behold his blood is
they knew not that joseph understood them for the interpreter was between them
he turned himself about from them and wept and he returned to them and spoke to them and took simeon from among them and bound him before their eyes
joseph commanded to fill their vessels with corn and to restore every money into his sack and to give them provision for the way and thus was it done unto them
they laded their asses with their corn and departed thence
as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodgingplace he espied his money and behold it was in the mouth of his sack
he said unto his brethren money is restored and lo it is even in my and their heart failed them and they turned trembling one to another saying is this that god hath done unto
they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan and told him all that had befallen them saying
man the lord of the land spoke roughly with us and took us for spies of the country
we said unto him we are upright men we are no spies
are twelve brethren sons of our father one is not and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan
genesis
and the man the lord of the land said unto us hereby shall i know that ye are upright men leave one of your brethren with me and take corn for the famine of your houses and go your way
bring your youngest brother unto me then shall i know that ye are no spies but that ye are upright men so will i deliver you your brother and ye shall traffic in the
it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold every bundle of money was in his sack and when they and their father saw their bundles of money they were afraid
jacob their father said unto them have ye bereaved of my children joseph is not and simeon is not and ye will take benjamin away upon me are all these things
reuben spoke unto his father saying shalt slay my two sons if i bring him not to thee deliver him into my hand and i will bring him back to
he said son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he only is left if harm befall him by the way in which ye go then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave and the famine was sore in the land
it came to pass when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of egypt that their father said unto them again buy us a little
judah spoke unto him saying man did earnestly forewarn us saying ye shall
not see my face except your brother be with you
thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buy thee food
if thou wilt not send him we will not go down for the man said unto us ye shall not see my face except your brother be with
and israel said dealt ye so ill with me as to tell the man whether ye had yet a
they said man asked straitly concerning ourselves and concerning our kindred saying is your father yet alive have ye another brother and we told him according to the tenor of these words could we in any wise know that he would say bring your brother
judah said unto israel his father the lad with me and we will arise and go that we may live and not die both we and thou and also our little ones
will be surety for him of my hand shalt thou require him if i bring him not unto thee and set him before thee then let me bear the blame for ever
except we had lingered surely we had now returned a second
their father israel said unto them it be so now do this take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels and carry down the man a present a little balm and a little honey spicery and ladanum nuts and almonds
take double money in your hand and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry back in your hand peradventure it was an oversight
also your brother and
genesis arise go again unto the man
god almighty give you mercy before the man that he may release unto you your other brother and benjamin and as for me if i be bereaved of my children i am
and the men took that present and they took double money in their hand and benjamin and rose up and went down to egypt and stood before joseph
when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the steward of his house the men into the house and kill the beasts and prepare the meat for the men shall dine with me at
the man did as joseph bade and the man brought the men into house
and the men were afraid because they were brought into house and they said of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us and take us for bondmen and our
they came near to the steward of house and they spoke unto him at the door of the house
said my lord we came indeed down at the first time to buy food
it came to pass when we came to the lodgingplace that we opened our sacks and behold every money was in the mouth of his sack our money in full weight and we have brought it back in our hand
and other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food we know not who put our money in our
he said be to you fear not your god and the god of your father hath given you treasure in your sacks i had your and he brought simeon out unto them
and the man brought the men into house and gave them water and they washed their feet and he gave their asses provender
they made ready the present against coming at noon for they heard that they should eat bread there
and when joseph came home they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed down to him to the earth
he asked them of their welfare and said your father well the old man of whom ye spoke is he yet
and they said servant our father is well he is yet and they bowed the head and made obeisance
he lifted up his eyes and saw benjamin his brother his son and said this your youngest brother of whom ye spoke unto and he said be gracious unto thee my
joseph made haste for his heart yearned toward his brother and he sought where to weep and he entered into his chamber and wept there
and he washed his face and came out and he refrained himself and said on
they set on for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the egyptians that did eat with him by themselves because the egyptians might not eat
genesis bread with the hebrews for that is an abomination unto the egyptians
they sat before him the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth and the men marvelled one with another
and portions were taken unto them from before him but portion was five times so much as any of theirs and they drank and were merry with him and he commanded the steward of his house saying the sacks with food as much as they can carry and put every money in his mouth
and put my goblet the silver goblet in the mouth of the youngest and his corn and he did according to the word that joseph had spoken
soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they and their asses
when they were gone out of the city and were not yet far off joseph said unto his steward follow after the men and when thou dost overtake them say unto them wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good
not this it in which my lord drinketh and whereby he indeed divineth ye have done evil in so
he overtook them and he spoke unto them these words
they said unto him speaketh my lord such words as these far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing
the money which we found in our we brought back unto
thee out of the land of canaan how then should we steal out of thy house silver or gold
whomsoever of thy servants it be found let him die and we also will be my
he said also let it be according unto your words he with whom it is found shall be my bondman and ye shall be
they hastened and took down every man his sack to the ground and opened every man his sack
he searched beginning at the eldest and leaving off at the youngest and the goblet was found in sack
they rent their clothes and laded every man his ass and returned to the city
judah and his brethren came to house and he was yet there and they fell before him on the ground
joseph said unto them deed is this that ye have done know ye not that such a man as i will indeed
judah said shall we say unto my lord what shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves god hath found out the iniquity of thy servants behold we are my bondmen both we and he also in whose hand the cup is
and he said be it from me that i should do so the man in whose hand the goblet is found he shall be my bondman but as for you get you up in peace unto your
genesis
then judah came near unto him and said my lord let thy servant i pray thee speak a word in my ears and let not thine anger burn against thy servant for thou art even as pharaoh
lord asked his servants saying have ye a father or a brother
we said unto my lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loveth him
thou saidst unto thy servants bring him down unto me that i may set mine eyes upon him
and we said unto my lord the lad cannot leave his father for if he should leave his father his father would die
and thou saidst unto thy servants except your youngest brother come down with you ye shall see my face no more
it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father we told him the words of my lord
our father said go again buy us a little food
we said we cannot go down if our youngest brother be with us then will we go down for we may not see the face except our youngest brother be with us
thy servant my father said unto us ye know that my wife bore me two sons
the one went out from me and i said surely he is torn in pieces and i have not seen him since
if ye take this one also from me and harm befall him ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave
therefore when i come to thy servant my father and the lad is not with us seeing that his soul is bound up with the soul
will come to pass when he seeth that the lad is not with us that he will die and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave
thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father saying if i bring him not unto thee then shall i bear the blame to my father for ever
therefore let thy servant i pray thee abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethren
how shall i go up to my father if the lad be not with me lest i look upon the evil that shall come on my then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried every man to go out from and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brethren
he wept aloud and the egyptians heard and the house of pharaoh heard
joseph said unto his brethren am joseph doth my father yet and his brethren could not answer him for they were affrighted at his presence
joseph said unto his brethren near to me i pray and they came near and he said am joseph your brother whom ye sold into egypt
and now be not grieved nor angry
genesis with yourselves that ye sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life
these two years hath the famine been in the land and there are yet five years in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest
and god sent me before you to give you a remnant on the earth and to save you alive for a great deliverance
now it was not you that sent me hither but god and he hath made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of egypt
ye and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son joseph god hath made me lord of all egypt come down unto me tarry not
thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast
and there will i sustain thee for there are yet five years of famine lest thou come to poverty thou and thy household and all that thou hast
and behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you
and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt and of all that ye have seen and ye shall hasten and bring down my father
he fell upon his brother neck and wept and benjamin wept upon his neck
he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them and after that his brethren talked with him
and the report thereof was heard in house saying brethren are and it pleased pharaoh well and his servants
pharaoh said unto joseph unto thy brethren this do ye lade your beasts and go get you unto the land of canaan
take your father and your households and come unto me and i will give you the good of the land of egypt and ye shall eat the fat of the land
thou art commanded this do ye take you wagons out of the land of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come
also regard not your stuff for the good things of all the land of egypt are
the sons of israel did so and joseph gave them wagons according to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for the way
all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but to benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five changes of raiment
to his father he sent in like manner ten asses laden with the good things of egypt and ten sheasses laden with corn and bread and victual for his father by the way
he sent his brethren away and they departed and he said unto them that ye fall not out by the
they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaan unto jacob their father
they told him saying is yet alive and he is ruler over all the land of and
genesis his heart fainted for he believed them not
they told him all the words of joseph which he had said unto them and when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of jacob their father revived
and israel said is enough joseph my son is yet alive i will go and see him before i and israel took his journey with all that he had and came to beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac
god spoke unto israel in the visions of the night and said and he said am
he said am god the god of thy father fear not to go down into egypt for i will there make of thee a great nation
i will go down with thee into egypt and i will also surely bring thee up again and joseph shall put his hand upon thine
jacob rose up from beersheba and the sons of israel carried jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry him
they took their cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of canaan and came into egypt jacob and all his seed with him

and he sent judah before him unto joseph to show the way before him unto goshen and they came into the land of goshen
joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet israel his father to goshen and he presented himself unto him and fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while
israel said unto joseph let me die since i have seen thy face that thou art yet
joseph said unto his brethren and unto his house will go up and tell pharaoh and will say unto him my brethren and my house who were in the land of canaan are come unto me
the men are shepherds for they have been keepers of cattle and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have
it shall come to pass when pharaoh shall call you and shall say what is your occupation
ye shall say thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now both we and our fathers that ye may dwell in the land of goshen for every shepherd is an abomination unto the then joseph went in and told pharaoh and said father and my brethren and their flocks and their herds and all that they have are come out of the land of canaan and behold they are in the land of
from among his brethren he took five men and presented them unto pharaoh
pharaoh said unto his brethren is your and they said unto pharaoh servants are shepherds both we and our
and they said unto pharaoh sojourn in the land are we come for there is no pasture for thy for the famine is sore in the land of canaan now therefore we pray thee let thy servants dwell in the land of
pharaoh spoke unto joseph saying father and thy brethren are come unto thee
the land of egypt is before thee in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell in the land of goshen let them dwell and if thou knowest any able men among them then make them rulers over my
and joseph brought in jacob his father and set him before pharaoh and jacob blessed pharaoh
pharaoh said unto jacob many are the days of the years of thy
and jacob said unto pharaoh
genesis days of the years of my sojournings are a hundred and thirty years few and evil have been the days of the years of my life and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their
jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from the presence of pharaoh
joseph placed his father and his brethren and gave them a possession in the land of egypt in the best of the land in the land of rameses as pharaoh had commanded
joseph sustained his father and his brethren and all his household with bread according to the want of their little ones
and there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very sore so that the land of egypt and the land of canaan languished by reason of the famine
joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan for the corn which they bought and joseph brought the money into house
when the money was all spent in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan all the egyptians came unto joseph and said us bread for why should we die in thy presence for our money
joseph said your cattle and i will give you bread for your cattle if money
they brought their cattle unto joseph and joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses and for the flocks and for the herds and for the asses and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year
when that year was ended they came unto him the second year and said unto him will not hide from my lord how that our money is all spent and the herds of cattle are my there is nought left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands
wherefore should we die before thine eyes both we and our land buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be bondmen unto pharaoh and give us seed that we may live and not die and that the land be not
joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh for the egyptians sold every man his field because the famine was sore upon them and the land became
and as for the people he removed them city by city from one end of the border of egypt even to the other end thereof
the land of the priests bought he not for the priests had a portion from pharaoh and did eat their portion which pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their land
then joseph said unto the people i have bought you this day and your land for pharaoh lo here is seed for you and ye shall sow the land
it shall come to pass at the ingatherings that ye shall give a fifth unto pharaoh and four parts shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for them of your households and for food for your little
genesis
they said hast saved our lives let us find favour in the sight of my lord and we will be
joseph made it a statute concerning the land of egypt unto this day that pharaoh should have the fifth only the land of the priests alone became not
israel dwelt in the land of egypt in the land of goshen and they got them possessions therein and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly
and jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years so the days of jacob the years of his life were a hundred forty and seven years
the time drew near that israel must die and he called his son joseph and said unto him now i have found favour in thy sight put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me bury me not i pray thee in egypt
when i sleep with my fathers thou shalt carry me out of egypt and bury me in their and he said will do as thou hast
he said unto and he swore unto him and israel bowed down upon the head and it came to pass after these things that one said to joseph thy father is and he took with him his two sons manasseh and ephraim
one told jacob and said thy son joseph cometh unto and israel strengthened
himself and sat upon the bed
jacob said unto joseph almighty appeared unto me at luz in the land of canaan and blessed me
and said unto me behold i will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and i will make of thee a company of peoples and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession
now thy two sons who were born unto thee in the land of egypt before i came unto thee into egypt are mine ephraim and manasseh even as reuben and simeon shall be mine
thy issue that thou begettest after them shall be thine they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance
as for me when i came from paddan rachel died unto me in the land of canaan in the way when there was still some way to come unto ephrath and i buried her there in the way to same is
israel beheld sons and said are
joseph said unto his father are my sons whom god hath given me and he said them i pray thee unto me and i will bless
now the eyes of israel were dim for age so that he could not see and he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced them
and israel said unto joseph had not thought to see thy face and lo god hath let me see thy seed
and joseph brought them out from between his knees and he fell down
genesis on his face to the earth
joseph took them both ephraim in his right hand toward left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward right hand and brought them near unto him
israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon head who was the younger and his left hand upon head guiding his hands wittingly for manasseh was the firstborn

and moses went out from pharaoh and entreated the lord
the lord did according to the word of moses and he removed the swarms of flies from pharaoh from his servants and from his people there remained
exodus not one
pharaoh hardened his heart this time also and he did not let the people go
then the lord said unto moses in unto pharaoh and tell him thus saith the lord the god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me
if thou refuse to let them go and wilt hold them still
behold the hand of the lord is upon thy cattle which are in the field upon the horses upon the asses upon the camels upon the herds and upon the flocks there shall be a very grievous murrain
the lord shall make a division between the cattle of israel and the cattle of egypt and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children of
the lord appointed a set time saying the lord shall do this thing in the
the lord did that thing on the morrow and all the cattle of egypt died but of the cattle of the children of israel died not one
and pharaoh sent and behold there was not so much as one of the cattle of the israelites dead but the heart of pharaoh was stubborn and he did not let the people go
and the lord said unto moses and unto aaron to you handfuls of soot of the furnace and let moses throw it heavenward in the sight of pharaoh
it shall become small dust over all the land of egypt and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast throughout all the land of
and they took soot of the furnace and stood before pharaoh and moses threw it up heavenward and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast
the magicians could not stand before moses because of the boils for the boils were upon the magicians and upon all the egyptians
the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh and he hearkened not unto them as the lord had spoken unto moses
and the lord said unto moses up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh and say unto him thus saith the lord the god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me
i will this time send all my plagues upon thy person and upon thy servants and upon thy people that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth
now i had put forth my hand and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence and thou hadst been cut off from the earth
in very deed for this cause have i made thee to stand to show thee my power and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth
yet exaltest thou thyself against my people that thou wilt not let them go
behold tomorrow about this time i will cause it to rain a very grievous hail such as hath not been in egypt since the day it was founded even until now
therefore send hasten in thy cattle and all that thou hast in the
exodus field for every man and beast that shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home the hail shall come down upon them and they shall
that feared the word of the lord among the servants of pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses
he that regarded not the word of the lord left his servants and his cattle in the field
and the lord said unto moses forth thy hand toward heaven that there may be hail in all the land of egypt upon man and upon beast and upon every herb of the field throughout the land of
moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven and the lord sent thunder and hail and fire ran down unto the earth and the lord caused to hail upon the land of egypt
there was hail and fire flashing up amidst the hail very grievous such as had not been in all the land of egypt since it became a nation
the hail smote throughout all the land of egypt all that was in the field both man and beast and the hail smote every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field
in the land of goshen where the children of israel were was there no hail
pharaoh sent and called for moses and aaron and said unto them have sinned this time the lord is righteous and i and my people are wicked
the lord and let there be enough of these mighty thunderings and hail and i will let you go and ye shall stay no
moses said unto him soon as i am gone out of the city i will spread forth my hands unto the lord the thunders shall cease neither shall there be any more hail that thou mayest know that the earth is the
as for thee and thy servants i know that ye will not yet fear the lord
and the flax and the barley were smitten for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bloom
the wheat and the spelt were not smitten for they ripen
moses went out of the city from pharaoh and spread forth his hands unto the lord and the thunders and hail ceased and the rain was not poured upon the earth
and when pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased he sinned yet more and hardened his heart he and his servants
and the heart of pharaoh was hardened and he did not let the children of israel go as the lord had spoken by moses
and the lord said unto moses in unto pharaoh for i have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants that i might show these my signs in the midst of them
and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy son what i have wrought upon egypt and my signs which i have done among them that ye may know that i am the
and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh and said unto him
exodus saith the lord the god of the hebrews how long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me let my people go that they may serve me
else if thou refuse to let my people go behold tomorrow will i bring locusts into thy border
they shall cover the face of the earth that one shall not be able to see the earth and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped which remaineth unto you from the hail and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field
and thy houses shall be filled and the houses of all thy servants and the houses of all the egyptians as neither thy fathers nor thy have seen since the day that they were upon the earth unto this and he turned and went out from pharaoh
servants said unto him long shall this man be a snare unto us let the men go that they may serve the lord their god knowest thou not yet that egypt is
and moses and aaron were brought again unto pharaoh and he said unto them serve the lord your god but who are they that shall
moses said will go with our young and with our old with our sons and with our daughters with our flocks and with our herds we will go for we must hold a feast unto the
he said unto them be the lord with you as i will let you go and your little ones see ye that evil is before your face
so go now ye that are men and serve the lord for that is what ye and they were driven out from presence
and the lord said unto moses out thy hand over the land of egypt for the locusts that they may come up upon the land of egypt and eat every herb of the land even all that the hail hath
moses stretched forth his rod over the land of egypt and the lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all the night and when it was morning the east wind brought the locusts
and the locusts went up over all the land of egypt and rested in all the borders of egypt very grievous were they before them there were no such locusts as they neither after them shall be such
they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land was darkened and they did eat every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left and there remained not any green thing either tree or herb of the field through all the land of egypt
pharaoh called for moses and aaron in haste and he said have sinned against the lord your god and against you
therefore forgive i pray thee my sin only this once and entreat the lord your god that he may take away from me this death
he went out from pharaoh and entreated the lord
and the lord turned an exceeding strong west wind which took up the locusts and drove them into the red sea there remained not one locust in all the border of egypt
the lord
exodus hardened heart and he did not let the children of israel go
and the lord said unto moses out thy hand toward heaven that there may be darkness over the land of egypt even darkness which may be
moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there was a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days
saw not one another neither rose any from his place for three days but all the children of israel had light in their dwellings
pharaoh called unto moses and said ye serve the lord only let your flocks and your herds be stayed let your little ones also go with
moses said must also give into our hand sacrifices and burntofferings that we may sacrifice unto the lord our god
our cattle also shall go with us there shall not a hoof be left behind for thereof must we take to serve the lord our god and we know not with what we must serve the lord until we come
the lord hardened heart and he would not let them go
pharaoh said unto him thee from me take heed to thyself see my face no more for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt
and moses said hast spoken well i will see thy face again no
and the lord said unto moses one plague more will i bring upon pharaoh and upon egypt afterwards he will let you go hence when he shall let you go he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether
now in the ears of the people and let them ask every man of his neighbour and every woman of her neighbour jewels of silver and jewels of
the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the egyptians moreover the man moses was very great in the land of egypt in the sight of servants and in the sight of the people
and moses said saith the lord about midnight will i go out into the midst of egypt
all the firstborn in the land of egypt shall die from the firstborn of pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill and all the firstborn of cattle
there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt such as there hath been none like it nor shall be like it any more
against any of the children of israel shall not a dog whet his tongue against man or beast that ye may know how that the lord doth put a difference between the egyptians and israel
all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bow down unto me saying get thee out and all the people that follow thee and after that i will go and he went out from pharaoh in hot anger
and the lord said unto moses will not hearken unto you that my wonders may be multiplied in
exodus the land of
moses and aaron did all these wonders before pharaoh and the lord hardened heart and he did not let the children of israel go out of his land and the lord spoke unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying
month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you
ye unto all the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to their a lamb for a household
if the household be too little for a lamb then shall he and his neighbour next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls according to every eating ye shall make your count for the lamb
your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it from the sheep or from the goats
ye shall keep it unto the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it at dusk
they shall take of the blood and put it on the two sideposts and on the lintel upon the houses wherein they shall eat it
they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread with bitter herbs they shall eat it
not of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with fire its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning but that which
remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire
thus shall ye eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in is the passover
i will go through the land of egypt in that night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgments i am the lord
the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt
this day shall be unto you for a memorial and ye shall keep it a feast to the lord throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever
days shall ye eat unleavened bread howbeit the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day that soul shall be cut off from israel
in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation and in the seventh day a holy convocation no manner of work shall be done in them save that which every man must eat that only may be done by you
ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread for in this selfsame day have i brought your hosts out of the land of egypt therefore shall ye observe this day throughout your generations by an
exodus ordinance for ever
the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at even ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month at even
days shall there be no leaven found in your houses for whosoever eateth that which is leavened that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of israel whether he be a sojourner or one that is born in the land
shall eat nothing leavened in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened
then moses called for all the elders of israel and said unto them out and take you lambs according to your families and kill the passover lamb
ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin and strike the lintel and the two sideposts with the blood that is in the basin and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning
the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two sideposts the lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you
ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever
it shall come to pass when ye be come to the land which the lord will give you according as he hath promised that ye shall keep this service
it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto you what mean ye by this service
ye shall say it is the sacrifice of the passover for that he passed over the houses of the children of israel in egypt when he smote the egyptians and delivered our and the people bowed the head and worshipped
the children of israel went and did so as the lord had commanded moses and aaron so did they
and it came to pass at midnight that the lord smote all the firstborn in the land of egypt from the firstborn of pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon and all the firstborn of cattle
pharaoh rose up in the night he and all his servants and all the egyptians and there was a great cry in egypt for there was not a house where there was not one dead
he called for moses and aaron by night and said up get you forth from among my people both ye and the children of israel and go serve the lord as ye have said
both your flocks and your herds as ye have said and be gone and bless me
and the egyptians were urgent upon the people to send them out of the land in haste for they said are all dead
the people took their dough before it was leavened their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders
and the children of israel did according to the word of moses and they asked of the egyptians jewels of
exodus silver and jewels of gold and raiment
and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the egyptians so that they let them have what they asked and they despoiled the egyptians
and the children of israel journeyed from rameses to succoth about six hundred thousand men on foot beside children
a mixed multitude went up also with them and flocks and herds even very much cattle
they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of egypt for it was not leavened because they were thrust out of egypt and could not tarry neither had they prepared for themselves any victual
the time that the children of israel dwelt in egypt was four hundred and thirty years
it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years even the selfsame day it came to pass that all the host of the lord went out from the land of egypt
was a night of watching unto the lord for bringing them out from the land of egypt this same night is a night of watching unto the lord for all the children of israel throughout their generations
and the lord said unto moses and aaron is the ordinance of the passover there shall no alien eat thereof
every servant that is bought for money when thou hast circumcised him then shall he eat thereof
sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof
one house shall it be eaten thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house neither shall ye break a bone thereof
the congregation of israel shall keep it
when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the passover to the lord let all his males be circumcised and then let him come near and keep it and he shall be as one that is born in the land but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof
law shall be to him that is homeborn and unto the stranger that sojourneth among
did all the children of israel as the lord commanded moses and aaron so did they
and it came to pass the selfsame day that the lord did bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their hosts and the lord spoke unto moses saying
unto me all the firstborn whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of israel both of man and of beast it is
and moses said unto the people this day in which ye came out from egypt out of the house of bondage for by strength of hand the lord brought you out from this place there shall no leavened bread be eaten
this day ye go forth in the month abib
it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanite and the hittite and the amorite and the hivite and the jebusite which he swore unto thy
exodus fathers to give thee a land flowing with milk and honey that thou shalt keep this service in this month
days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the lord
bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy borders
thou shalt tell thy son in that day saying it is because of that which the lord did for me when i came forth out of egypt
it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand and for a memorial between thine eyes that the law of the lord may be in thy mouth for with a strong hand hath the lord brought thee out of egypt
shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanite as he swore unto thee and to thy fathers and shall give it thee
that thou shalt set apart unto the lord all that openeth the womb every firstling that is a male which thou hast coming of a beast shall be the
and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break its neck and all the firstborn of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem
it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what is this that thou shalt say unto him by strength of hand the lord brought us out from egypt from the house of bondage
it came to pass when pharaoh would hardly let us go that the lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast therefore i sacrifice to the lord all that openeth the womb being males but all the firstborn of my sons i redeem
it shall be for a sign upon thy hand and for frontlets between thine eyes for by strength of hand the lord brought us forth out of
and it came to pass when pharaoh had let the people go that god led them not by the way of the land of the philistines although that was near for god said peradventure the people repent when they see war and they return to
god led the people about by the way of the wilderness by the red sea and the children of israel went up armed out of the land of egypt
moses took the bones of joseph with him for he had straitly sworn the children of israel saying will surely remember you and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with
and they took their journey from succoth and encamped in etham in the edge of the wilderness
the lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light that they might go by day and by night
pillar of cloud by
exodus day and the pillar of fire by night departed not from before the people and the lord spoke unto moses saying
unto the children of israel that they turn back and encamp before pihahiroth between migdol and the sea before baalzephon over against it shall ye encamp by the sea
pharaoh will say of the children of israel they are entangled in the land the wilderness hath shut them in
i will harden heart and he shall follow after them and i will get me honour upon pharaoh and upon all his host and the egyptians shall know that i am the and they did so
it was told the king of egypt that the people were fled and the heart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned towards the people and they said is this we have done that we have let israel go from serving us
and he made ready his chariots and took his people with him
he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the chariots of egypt and captains over all of them
the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt and he pursued after the children of israel for the children of israel went out with a high hand
the egyptians pursued after them all the horses and chariots of pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them encamping by the sea beside pihahiroth in front of baalzephon
when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lifted up
their eyes and behold the egyptians were marching after them and they were sore afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord
they said unto moses there were no graves in egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to bring us forth out of egypt
not this the word that we spoke unto thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it were better for us to serve the egyptians than that we should die in the
moses said unto the people ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will work for you today for whereas ye have seen the egyptians today ye shall see them again no more for ever
lord will fight for you and ye shall hold your
and the lord said unto moses criest thou unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward
lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground
i behold i will harden the hearts of the egyptians and they shall go in after them and i will get me honour upon pharaoh and upon all his host upon his chariots and upon his horsemen
the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i have gotten me honour upon pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his
the angel
exodus of god who went before the camp of israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of cloud removed from before them and stood behind them
and it came between the camp of egypt and the camp of israel and there was the cloud and the darkness here yet gave it light by night there and the one came not near the other all the night
moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided
the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left
the egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea all horses his chariots and his horsemen
it came to pass in the morning watch that the lord looked forth upon the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud and discomfited the host of the egyptians
he took off their chariot wheels and made them to drive heavily so that the egyptians said us flee from the face of israel for the lord fighteth for them against the
and the lord said unto moses out thy hand over the sea that the waters may come back upon the egyptians upon their chariots and upon their
moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared and the egyptians fled against it and the lord overthrew the egyptians in the midst of the sea
the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen even all the host of pharaoh that went in after them into the sea there remained not so much as one of them
the children of israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left
the lord saved israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the seashore
and israel saw the great work which the lord did upon the egyptians and the people feared the lord and they believed in the lord and in his servant moses
then sang moses and the children of israel this song unto the lord and spoke saying i will sing unto the lord for he is highly exalted the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea
the lord is my strength and song and he is become my salvation this is my god and i will glorify him my god and i will exalt him
the lord is a man of war the lord is his name
chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea
exodus and his chosen captains are sunk in the red sea
the deeps cover they went down into the depths like a stone
thy right hand o lord glorious in power thy right hand o lord dasheth in pieces the enemy
and in the greatness of thine excellency thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee thou sendest forth thy wrath it consumeth them as stubble
and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled the floods stood upright as a heap the deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea
the enemy said will pursue i will overtake i will divide the spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them i will draw my sword my hand shall destroy
thou didst blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank as lead in the mighty waters
who is like unto thee o lord among the mighty who is like unto thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders
thou stretchedst out thy right the earth swallowed them
thou in thy love hast led the people that thou hast redeemed thou hast guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation
the peoples have heard they tremble pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of philistia
then were the chiefs of edom affrighted the mighty men of moab trembling taketh hold upon them all the inhabitants of canaan are melted away
terror and dread falleth upon them by the greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone till thy people pass over o lord till the people pass over that thou hast gotten
thou bringest them in and plantest them in the mountain of thine inheritance the place o lord which thou hast made for thee to dwell in the sanctuary o lord which thy hands have established
the lord shall reign for ever and ever
for the horses of pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea and the lord brought back the waters of the sea upon them but the children of israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea
and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel in her
exodus hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances
and miriam sang unto them sing ye to the lord for he is highly exalted the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea
and moses led israel onward from the red sea and they went out into the wilderness of shur and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water
when they came to marah they could not drink of the waters of marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called a marah
the people murmured against moses saying shall we
he cried unto the lord and the lord showed him a tree and he cast it into the waters and the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he proved them
and he said thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god and wilt do that which is right in his eyes and wilt give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes i will put none of the diseases upon thee which i have put upon the egyptians for i am the lord that healeth
and they came to elim where were twelve springs of water and three score and ten palmtrees and they encamped there by the waters a that is bitterness
and they took their journey from elim and all the congregation of the children of israel came unto the wilderness of sin which is between elim and sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of egypt
the whole congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron in the wilderness
the children of israel said unto them that we had died by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt when we sat by the fleshpots when we did eat bread to the full for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with
then said the lord unto moses i will cause to rain bread from heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a portion every day that i may prove them whether they will walk in my law or not
it shall come to pass on the sixth day that they shall prepare that which they bring in and it shall be twice as much as they gather
and moses and aaron said unto all the children of israel even then ye shall know that the lord hath brought you out from the land of egypt
in the morning then ye shall see the glory of the lord for that he hath heard your murmurings against the lord and what are we that ye murmur against
moses said shall be when the lord shall give you in the evening flesh to
exodus eat and in the morning bread to the full for that the lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him and what are we your murmurings are not against us but against the
moses said unto aaron unto all the congregation of the children of israel come near before the lord for he hath heard your
it came to pass as aaron spoke unto the whole congregation of the children of israel that they looked toward the wilderness and behold the glory of the lord appeared in the cloud
the lord spoke unto moses saying
have heard the murmurings of the children of israel speak unto them saying at dusk ye shall eat flesh and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread and ye shall know that i am the lord your
it came to pass at even that the quails came up and covered the camp and in the morning there was a layer of dew round about the camp
when the layer of dew was gone up behold upon the face of the wilderness a fine scalelike thing fine as the hoarfrost on the ground
and when the children of israel saw it they said one to another is they knew not what it was and moses said unto them is the bread which the lord hath given you to eat
is the thing which the lord hath commanded gather ye of it every man according to his eating an a heb man hu omer a head according to the number of your persons shall ye take it every man for them that are in his
and the children of israel did so and gathered some more some less
when they did mete it with an omer he that gathered much had nothing over and he that gathered little had no lack they gathered every man according to his eating
moses said unto them no man leave of it till the
they hearkened not unto moses but some of them left of it until the morning and it bred worms and rotted and moses was wroth with them
they gathered it morning by morning every man according to his eating and as the sun waxed hot it melted
it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread two omers for each one and all the rulers of the congregation came and told moses
he said unto them is that which the lord hath spoken tomorrow is a solemn rest a holy sabbath unto the lord bake that which ye will bake and seethe that which ye will seethe and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the
they laid it up till the morning as moses bade and it did not rot neither was there any worm therein
moses said that today for today is a sabbath unto the lord today ye shall not find it in the field
days ye shall gather it but on the seventh day is the sabbath in it there shall be
exodus
it came to pass on the seventh day that there went out some of the people to gather and they found none
the lord said unto moses long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws
that the lord hath given you the sabbath therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days abide ye every man in his place let no man go out of his place on the seventh
the people rested on the seventh day
the house of israel called the name thereof amanna and it was like coriander seed white and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey
moses said is the thing which the lord hath commanded let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations that they may see the bread wherewith i fed you in the wilderness when i brought you forth from the land of
moses said unto aaron a jar and put an omerful of manna therein and lay it up before the lord to be kept throughout your
as the lord commanded moses so aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept
and the children of israel did eat the manna forty years until they came to a land inhabited they did eat the manna until they came unto the borders of the land of canaan
an omer is the tenth part of an ephah
and all the congregation of the children of israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin by their stages according to the commandment of the lord and encamped in rephidim and there was no water for the people to drink
wherefore the people strove with moses and said us water that we may and moses said unto them strive ye with me wherefore do ye try the
the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against moses and said hast thou brought us up out of egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with
and moses cried unto the lord saying shall i do unto this people they are almost ready to stone
the lord said unto moses on before the people and take with thee of the elders of israel and thy rod wherewith thou smotest the river take in thy hand and go
behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel
the name of the place was called bmassah and c meribah because of the striving of the children of israel and because they tried the lord saying the lord among us or b a c heb man

the lord said unto moses have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people
therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot against them and that i may consume them and i will make of thee a great
moses besought the lord his god and said why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people that thou hast brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand
wherefore should the egyptians speak saying for evil did he bring them forth to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people

he said is not the voice of them that shout for mastery neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the
exodus noise of them that sing do i
and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and waxed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and broke them beneath the mount

moses said unto aaron did this people unto thee that thou hast brought a great sin upon
aaron said not the anger of my lord wax hot thou knowest the people that they are set on evil
they said unto me make us a god which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we know not what is become of him
and i said unto them whosoever hath any gold let them break it off so they gave it me and i cast it into the fire and there came out this
and when moses saw that the people were broken aaron had let them loose for a derision among their
moses stood in the gate of the camp and said is on the side let him come unto and all the sons of levi gathered themselves together unto him
he said unto them saith the lord the god of israel put ye every man his sword upon his thigh and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his companion and every man his
the sons of levi did according to the word of moses and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men
moses said yourselves today to the lord for every man hath been against his son and against his brother that he may also bestow upon you a blessing this

it came to pass when moses went out unto the tent that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after moses until he was gone into the tent
it came to pass when moses entered into the tent the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the door of the tent and the lord spoke with moses
when all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the tent all the people rose up and worshipped every man at his tent door
the lord spoke unto moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he would return into the camp but his minister joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the tent
and moses said unto the lord thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me yet thou hast said i know thee by name and thou hast also found grace in my sight
therefore i pray thee if i have found grace in thy sight show me now thy ways that i may know thee to the end that i may find grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy
he said presence shall go with thee and i will give thee
he said unto him thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence
for wherein now shall it be known that i have found grace in thy sight i and thy people is it not in that thou goest with us so that we are distinguished i and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the
and the lord said unto moses will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and i know thee by
and he said me i pray thee thy

exodus thee and will proclaim the name of the lord before thee and i will be gracious to whom i will be gracious and will show mercy on whom i will show
he said canst not see my face for man shall not see me and
the lord said there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon the rock
and it shall come to pass while my glory passeth by that i will put thee in a cleft of the rock and will cover thee with my hand until i have passed by
and i will take away my hand and thou shalt see my back but my face shall not be and the lord said unto moses thee two tables of stone like unto the first and i will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou didst break
be ready by the morning and come up in the morning unto mount sinai and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount
and no man shall come up with thee neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that

the lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the lord
and the lord passed by before him and proclaimed lord the lord
god merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth

moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped
he said now i have found grace in thy sight o lord let the lord i pray thee go in the midst of us for it is a stiffnecked people and pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for thine

he said unto him will not go but i will depart to mine own land and to my
and he said us not i pray thee forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes
and it shall be if thou go with us yea it shall be that what good soever the lord shall do unto us the same will we do unto
and they set forward from the mount of the lord three and the ark of the covenant of the lord went before them three to seek out a restingplace for them
and the cloud of the lord was over them by day when they set forward from the camp
and it came to pass when the ark set forward that moses said up
numbers o lord and let thine enemies be scattered and let them that hate thee flee before
when it rested he said o lord unto the ten thousands of the families of and the people were as murmurers speaking evil in the ears of the lord and when the lord heard it his anger was kindled and the fire of the lord burnt among them and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp
the people cried unto moses and moses prayed unto the lord and the fire abated
the name of that place was called a taberah because the fire of the lord burnt among them
and the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting and the children of israel also wept on their part and said that we were given flesh to eat
remember the fish which we were wont to eat in egypt for nought the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic
now our soul is dried away there is nothing at all we have nought save this manna to look
the manna was like coriander seed and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium
the people went about and gathered it and ground it in mills or beat it in mortars and seethed it in pots and made cakes of it and the taste of it was as the taste of a cake baked with
a that is burning oil
when the dew fell upon the camp in the night the manna fell upon
moses heard the people weeping family by family every man at the door of his tent and the anger of the lord was kindled greatly and moses was displeased
moses said unto the lord hast thou dealt ill with thy servant and wherefore have i not found favour in thy sight that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me
i conceived all this people have i brought them forth that thou shouldest say unto me carry them in thy bosom as a nursingfather carrieth the sucking child unto the land which thou didst swear unto their fathers
whence should i have flesh to give unto all this people for they trouble me with their weeping saying give us flesh that we may eat
am not able to bear all this people myself alone because it is too heavy for me
if thou deal thus with me kill me i pray thee out of hand if i have found favour in thy sight and let me not look upon my
and the lord said unto moses unto me seventy men of the elders of israel whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people and officers over them and bring them unto the tent of meeting that they may stand there with thee
i will come down and speak with thee there and i will take of the spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them and they shall bear the burden of the
numbers people with thee that thou bear it not thyself alone
say thou unto the people sanctify yourselves against tomorrow and ye shall eat flesh for ye have wept in the ears of the lord saying would that we were given flesh to eat for it was well with us in egypt therefore the lord will give you flesh and ye shall eat
shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither ten days nor twenty days
a whole month until it come out at your nostrils and it be loathsome unto you because that ye have rejected the lord who is among you and have troubled him with weeping saying why now came we forth out of
moses said people among whom i am are six hundred thousand men on foot and yet thou hast said i will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month
flocks and herds be slain for them will they suffice them or if all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them will they suffice
the lord said unto moses the hand waxed short now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or
and moses went out and told the people the words of the lord and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and set them round about the tent
the lord came down in the cloud and spoke unto him and took of the spirit that was upon him and put it upon the seventy elders and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them they prophesied but they did so no more
there remained two men in the camp the name of the one was eldad and the name of the other medad and the spirit rested upon them and they were of them that were recorded but had not gone out unto the tent and they prophesied in the camp
there ran a young man and told moses and said and medad are prophesying in the
joshua the son of nun the minister of moses from his youth up answered and said lord moses shut them
moses said unto him thou jealous for my sake would that all the people were prophets that the lord would put his spirit upon them
moses withdrew into the camp he and the elders of israel
and there went forth a wind from the lord and brought across quails from the sea and let them fall by the camp about a journey on this side and a journey on the other side round about the camp and about two cubits above the face of the earth
and the people rose up all that day and all the night and all the next day and gathered the quails he that gathered least gathered ten heaps and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp
while the flesh was yet between their teeth ere it was chewed the anger of the lord was kindled against the
numbers people and the lord smote the people with a very great plague
the name of that place was called kibrothhattaavah because there they buried the people that lusted
a kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed unto hazeroth and they abode at hazeroth and miriam and aaron spoke against moses because of the cushite woman whom he had married for he had married a cushite woman
and they said the lord indeed spoken only with moses hath he not spoken also with and the lord heard
the man moses was very meek above all the men that were upon the face of the
and the lord spoke suddenly unto moses and unto aaron and unto miriam out ye three unto the tent of and they three came out
the lord came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the door of the tent and called aaron and miriam and they both came forth
and he said now my words if there be a prophet among you i the lord do make myself known unto him in a vision i do speak with him in a dream
servant moses is not so he is trusted in all my house
him do i speak mouth to mouth even manifestly and not in dark speeches and the similitude of the lord doth he behold wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant
a that is the graves of lust against
the anger of the lord was kindled against them and he departed
when the cloud was removed from over the tent behold miriam was leprous as white as snow and aaron looked upon miriam and behold she was leprous
and aaron said unto moses my lord lay not i pray thee sin upon us for that we have done foolishly and for that we have sinned
her not i pray be as one dead of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his
and moses cried unto the lord saying her now o god i beseech
and the lord said unto moses her father had but spit in her face should she not hide in shame seven days let her be shut up without the camp seven days and after that she shall be brought in
miriam was shut up without the camp seven days and the people journeyed not till miriam was brought in again
and afterward the people journeyed from hazeroth and pitched in the wilderness of paran
and the lord spoke unto moses saying
thou men that they may spy out the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man every one a prince among

they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of zin unto rehob at the entrance to hamath
they went up into the south and came unto hebron and ahiman sheshai and talmai the children of anak were hebron was built seven years before zoan in
they came unto the valley of eshcol and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bore it upon a pole between two they took also of the pomegranates and of the
place was called the valley of aeshcol because of the cluster which the children of israel cut down from
they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days
they went and came to moses and to aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of paran to kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land
they told him and said came unto the land whither thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it

caleb stilled the people toward moses and said should go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome
but the men that went up with him said are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than
they spread an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of israel saying land through which we have passed to spy it out is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature
there we saw the nephilim the sons of anak who come of the nephilim and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night
all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron and the whole congregation said unto them that we had died in the land of egypt or would we had died in this wilderness
wherefore doth the lord bring us unto this land to fall by the sword our wives and our little ones will be a prey were it not better for us to return into
they said one to another us make a captain and let us return into
then moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the
congregation of the children of israel
and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh who were of them that spied out the land rent their clothes
they spoke unto all the congregation of the children of israel saying land which we passed through to spy it out is an exceeding good land
the lord delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it unto land which floweth with milk and honey
rebel not against the lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bread for us their defence is removed from over them and the lord is with us fear them
all the congregation bade stone them with stones when the glory of the lord appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the children of israel
and the lord said unto moses long will this people despise me and how long will they not believe in me for all the signs which i have wrought among them
will smite them with the pestilence and destroy them and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than
and moses said unto the lord the egyptians shall thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among
will say to the inhabitants of this land who have heard that thou lord art in the midst of this people inasmuch as thou lord art seen face to face and thy cloud standeth over them and thou goest before them in a pillar of
numbers cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night
if thou shalt kill this people as one man then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak saying
the lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore unto them therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness
now i pray thee let the power of the lord be great according as thou hast spoken saying
lord is slow to anger and plenteous in lovingkindness forgiving iniquity and transgression and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children upon the third and upon the fourth generation
pardon i pray thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy lovingkindness and according as thou hast forgiven this people from egypt even until
and the lord said have pardoned according to thy
in very deed as i all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the
surely all those men that have seen my glory and my signs which i wrought in egypt and in the wilderness yet have put me to proof these ten times and have not hearkened to my voice

joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land
moses told these words unto all the children of israel and the people mourned greatly

the soul that doeth aught with a high hand whether he be homeborn or a stranger the same blasphemeth the lord and that soul shall be cut off from among his people
he hath despised the word of the lord and hath broken his commandment that soul shall utterly be cut off his iniquity shall be upon him
and while the children of israel were in the wilderness they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day
they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto moses and aaron and unto all the congregation

the lord said unto moses man shall surely be put to death all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the
all the congregation brought him without the camp and stoned him with stones and he died as the lord commanded moses
and the lord spoke unto moses saying
unto the children of israel and bid them that they make them throughout their generations fringes in the corners of their garments and that they put with the fringe of each corner a thread of blue
and it shall be unto you for a fringe that ye may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the lord and do them and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes after which ye use to go astray

they rose up in face of moses with certain of the children of israel two hundred and fifty men they were princes of the congregation the elect men of the assembly men of renown
and they assembled themselves together against moses and against aaron and said unto them take too much upon you seeing all the congregation are holy every one of them and the lord is among them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the assembly of the
and when moses heard it he fell upon his face

moses said unto korah now ye sons of levi
it but a small thing unto you that the god of israel hath separated you from the congregation of israel to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them
and that he hath brought thee near and all thy brethren the sons of levi with thee and will ye seek the priesthood also
thou and all thy company that are gathered together against the and as to aaron what is he that ye murmur against
moses sent to call dathan and abiram the sons of eliab and they said will not come up
is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us
moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards wilt thou put out the eyes of these men we will not come
moses was very wroth and said unto the lord not thou their offering i have not taken one ass from them neither have i hurt one of
moses said unto korah thou and all thy congregation before the lord thou and they and aaron tomorrow
take ye every man his firepan and put incense upon them and bring ye before the lord every man his firepan two hundred and fifty firepans thou also and aaron each his
they took every man his firepan and put fire in them and laid incense thereon and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with moses and aaron
korah assembled all the congregation against them unto the door of the tent of meeting and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the congregation
and the lord spoke unto moses and unto aaron saying
yourselves from among this congregation that i may consume them in a
they fell upon their faces and said god the god of the spirits of all flesh shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth with all the
and the lord spoke unto moses
saying unto the congregation saying get you up from about the dwelling of korah dathan and
moses rose up and went unto dathan and abiram and the elders of israel followed him
he spoke unto the congregation saying i pray you from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lest ye be swept away in all their
they got them up from
numbers the dwelling of korah dathan and abiram on every side and dathan and abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents with their wives and their sons and their little ones
and moses said ye shall know that the lord hath sent me to do all these works and that i have not done them of mine own mind
these men die the common death of all men and be visited after the visitation of all men then the lord hath not sent me
if the lord make a new thing and the ground open her mouth and swallow them up with all that appertain unto them and they go down alive into the pit then ye shall understand that these men have despised the
it came to pass as he made an end of speaking all these words that the ground did cleave asunder that was under them
the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their households and all the men that appertained unto korah and all their goods
they and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among the assembly
all israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them for they said the earth swallow us
fire came forth from the lord and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense and the lord spoke unto moses saying
unto
eleazar the son of aaron the priest that he take up the firepans out of the burning and scatter thou the fire yonder for they are become holy
even the firepans of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the they are become holy because they were offered before the they may be a sign unto the children of
eleazar the priest took the brazen firepans which they that were burnt had offered and they beat them out for a covering of the altar
be a memorial unto the children of israel to the end that no common man that is not of the seed of aaron draw near to burn incense before the lord that he fare not as korah and as his company as the lord spoke unto him by the hand of moses
but on the morrow all the congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron saying have killed the people of the
it came to pass when the congregation was assembled against moses and against aaron that they looked toward the tent of meeting and behold the cloud covered it and the glory of the lord appeared
moses and aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting
the lord spoke unto moses saying
you up from among this congregation that i may consume them in a and they fell upon their faces
moses said
numbers unto aaron thy firepan and put fire therein from off the altar and lay incense thereon and carry it quickly unto the congregation and make atonement for them for there is wrath gone out from the lord the plague is
aaron took as moses spoke and ran into the midst of the assembly and behold the plague was begun among the people and he put on the incense and made atonement for the people
he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was stayed
they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred besides them that died about the matter of korah
aaron returned unto moses unto the door of the tent of meeting and the plague was stayed
and the lord spoke unto moses saying
unto the children of israel and take of them rods one for each of all their princes according to their twelve rods thou shalt write every name upon his rod
thou shalt write name upon the rod of levi for there shall be one rod for the head of their
thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony where i meet with you
it shall come to pass that the man whom i shall choose his rod shall bud and i will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of israel which they murmur against
and moses spoke unto the children of israel and all their princes gave him rods for each prince one according to their even twelve rods and the rod of aaron was among their rods
moses laid up the rods before the lord in the tent of the testimony
it came to pass on the morrow that moses went into the tent of the testimony and behold the rod of aaron for the house of levi was budded and put forth buds and bloomed blossoms and bore ripe almonds
moses brought out all the rods from before the lord unto all the children of israel and they looked and took every man his rod
and the lord said unto moses back the rod of aaron before the testimony to be kept there for a token against the rebellious children that there may be made an end of their murmurings against me that they die
did moses as the lord commanded him so did he
and the children of israel spoke unto moses saying we perish we are undone we are all undone
one that cometh near that cometh near unto the tabernacle of the lord is to die shall we wholly and the lord said unto aaron and thy sons and thy with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood

thou shalt speak unto the levites and say unto them when ye take of the children of israel the tithe which i have given you from them for your inheritance then ye shall set apart of it a gift for the lord even a tithe of the tithe
the gift which ye set apart shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor and as the fulness of the winepress
ye also shall set apart a gift unto the lord of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of israel and thereof ye shall give the gift which is set apart unto the lord to aaron the priest
of all that is given you ye shall set apart all of that which is due unto the lord of all the best thereof even the hallowed part thereof out of it

and the children of israel even the whole congregation came into the wilderness of zin in the first month and the people abode in kadesh and miriam died there and was buried there
there was no water for the congregation and they assembled themselves together against moses and against aaron
the people strove with moses and spoke saying that we had perished when our brethren perished before the lord
why have ye brought the assembly of the lord into this wilderness to die there we and our cattle
wherefore have ye made us to come up out of egypt to bring us in unto this evil place it is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates neither is there any water to
moses and aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tent of meeting and fell upon their faces and the glory of the lord appeared unto them
the lord spoke unto moses saying
the rod and assemble the congregation thou and aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes that it give forth its water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle
moses took the rod from before the lord as he commanded him
moses and aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock and he said unto them now ye rebels are we to bring you forth water out of this
and moses lifted up his hand and smote the rock with his rod twice and water came forth abundantly and the congregation drank and their cattle
and the lord said unto moses and aaron ye believed not in me to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of israel therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which i have given
are the waters of ameribah where the children of israel strove with the lord and he was sanctified in them
and moses sent messengers from kadesh unto the king of edom saith thy brother israel thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us
how our fathers went down into egypt and we dwelt in egypt a long time and the egyptians dealt ill with a
that is strife numbers us and our fathers
when we cried unto the lord he heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us forth out of egypt and behold we are in kadesh a city in the uttermost of thy border

edom said unto him shalt not pass through me lest i come out with the sword against
the children of israel said unto him will go up by the highway and if we drink of thy water i and my cattle then will i give the price thereof let me only pass through on my feet there is no
and he said shalt not pass and edom came out against him with much people and with a strong hand
edom refused to give israel passage through his border wherefore israel turned away from him
and they journeyed from kadesh and the children of israel even the whole congregation came unto mount hor
the lord spoke unto moses and aaron in mount hor by the border of the land of edom saying
shall be gathered unto his people for he shall not enter into the land which i have given unto the children of israel because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of meribah
aaron and eleazar his son and bring them up unto mount hor
strip aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall die
moses did as the lord commanded and they went up into mount hor in the sight of all the congregation
moses stripped aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron died there in the top of the mount and moses and eleazar came down from the mount
when all the congregation saw that aaron was dead they wept for aaron thirty days even all the house of israel
and the canaanite the king of arad who dwelt in the south heard tell that israel came by the way of atharim and he fought against israel and took some of them captive
and israel vowed a vow unto the lord and said thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand then i will utterly destroy their
the lord hearkened to the voice of israel and delivered up the canaanites and they utterly destroyed them and their cities and the name of the place was called ahormah
and they journeyed from mount hor by the way to the red sea to compass the land of edom and the soul of the people became impatient because of the way

the people came to moses and said have sinned because we have spoken against the lord and against thee pray unto the lord that he take away the serpents from and moses prayed for the people
the lord said unto moses thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he seeth it shall
moses made a serpent of brass and set it upon the pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he looked unto the serpent of brass he lived
the children of israel journeyed and pitched in oboth
and they journeyed from oboth and pitched at ijeabarim in the wilderness which is in front of moab toward the sunrising
thence they journeyed and pitched in the valley of zered
thence they journeyed and pitched on the other side of the arnon which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the border of the arnon is the border of moab between moab and the amorites
it is said in the book of the wars of the lord vaheb in suphah and the valleys of arnon
and the slope of the valleys that inclineth toward the seat of ar and leaneth upon the border of
and from thence to abeer that is the well whereof the lord said unto moses the people together and i will give them

the well which the princes digged which the nobles of the people delved with the sceptre and with their staves and from the wilderness to mattanah
from mattanah to nahaliel and from nahaliel to bamoth
from bamoth to the valley that is in the field of moab by the top of pisgah which looketh down upon the desert
and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites saying
me pass through thy land we will not turn aside into field or into vineyard we will not drink of the water of the wells we will go by the highway until we have passed thy
sihon would not suffer israel to pass through his border but sihon gathered all his people together and went out against israel into the wilderness and came to a
that is a well numbers jahaz and he fought against israel
and israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from the arnon unto the jabbok even unto the children of ammon for the border of the children of ammon was strong
israel took all these cities and israel dwelt in all the cities of the amorites in heshbon and in all the towns thereof
heshbon was the city of sihon the king of the amorites who had fought against the former king of moab and taken all his land out of his hand even unto the arnon
they that speak in parables say come ye to heshbon let the city of sihon be built and established
for a fire is gone out of heshbon a flame from the city of sihon it hath devoured ar of moab the lords of the high places of arnon
woe to thee moab thou art undone o people of chemosh he hath given his sons as fugitives and his daughters into captivity unto sihon king of the amorites
we have shot at is unto dibon and we have laid waste even unto nophah which reacheth unto medeba
thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites
moses sent to spy out jazer and they took the towns thereof and drove out the amorites that were there
they turned and went up by the way of bashan and og the king of bashan went out against them he and all his people to battle at edrei
and the lord said unto moses him not for i have delivered him into thy hand and all his people and his land and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites who dwelt at
they smote him and his sons and all his people until there was none left him remaining and they possessed his land and the children of israel journeyed and pitched in the plains of moab beyond the jordan at jericho
and balak the son of zippor saw all that israel had done to the amorites
moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many and moab was overcome with dread because of the children of israel
and moab said unto the elders of midian will this multitude lick up all that is round about us as the ox licketh up the grass of the balak the son of zippor was king of moab at that
he sent messengers unto balaam the son of beor to pethor which is by the river to the land of the children of his people to call him saying there is a people come out from egypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide over against me
come now therefore i pray thee
numbers curse me this people for they are too mighty for me peradventure i shall prevail that we may smite them and that i may drive them out of the land for i know that he whom thou blessest is blessed and he whom thou cursest is
the elders of moab and the elders of midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand and they came unto balaam and spoke unto him the words of balak
he said unto them here this night and i will bring you back word as the lord may speak unto and the princes of moab abode with balaam
and god came unto balaam and said men are these with
and balaam said unto god the son of zippor king of moab hath sent unto me saying
the people that is come out of egypt it covereth the face of the earth now come curse me them peradventure i shall be able to fight against them and shall drive them
god said unto balaam shalt not go with them thou shalt not curse the people for they are
balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of balak you into your land for the lord refuseth to give me leave to go with
the princes of moab rose up and they went unto balak and said refuseth to come with
balak sent yet again princes more and more honourable than they
they came to balaam and said to him saith balak the son of zippor let nothing i pray thee hinder thee from coming unto me
i will promote thee unto very great honour and whatsoever thou sayest unto me i will do come therefore i pray thee curse me this
balaam answered and said unto the servants of balak balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the word of the lord my god to do any thing small or great
now therefore i pray you tarry ye also here this night that i may know what the lord will speak unto me
god came unto balaam at night and said unto him the men are come to call thee rise up go with them but only the word which i speak unto thee that shalt thou
balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went with the princes of moab
anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the lord placed himself in the way for an adversary against now he was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with
and the ass saw the angel of the lord standing in the way with his sword drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field and balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way
the angel of the lord stood in a hollow way between the vineyards a fence being on this side and a fence on that side
the ass saw the angel of the lord and she thrust herself unto the wall and crushed foot
numbers against the wall and he smote her again
the angel of the lord went further and stood in a narrow place where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left
the ass saw the angel of the lord and she lay down under balaam and anger was kindled and he smote the ass with his staff
the lord opened the mouth of the ass and she said unto balaam have i done unto thee that thou hast smitten me these three
balaam said unto the ass thou hast mocked me i would there were a sword in my hand for now i had killed
the ass said unto balaam not i thine ass upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day was i ever wont to do so unto and he said
the lord opened the eyes of balaam and he saw the angel of the lord standing in the way with his sword drawn in his hand and he bowed his head and fell on his face
the angel of the lord said unto him hast thou smitten thine ass these three times behold i am come forth for an adversary because thy way is contrary unto me
the ass saw me and turned aside before me these three times unless she had turned aside from me surely now i had even slain thee and saved her
balaam said unto the angel of the lord have sinned for i knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me now therefore if it displease thee i will get me
the angel of the lord said unto balaam with the men but only the word that i shall speak unto thee that thou shalt so balaam went with the princes of balak
when balak heard that balaam was come he went out to meet him unto irmoab which is on the border of arnon which is in the utmost part of the border
balak said unto balaam i not earnestly send unto thee to call thee wherefore camest thou not unto me am i not able indeed to promote thee to
balaam said unto balak i am come unto thee have i now any power at all to speak any thing the word that god putteth in my mouth that shall i
balaam went with balak and they came unto kiriathhuzoth
balak sacrificed oxen and sheep and sent to balaam and to the princes that were with him
it came to pass in the morning that balak took balaam and brought him up into bamothbaal and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people and balaam said unto balak me here seven altars and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven
balak did as balaam had spoken and balak and balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram
balaam said unto balak by thy burntoffering and i will go peradventure the lord will come to meet me and whatsoever he showeth me i will tell
numbers and he went to a bare height
and god met balaam and he said unto him have prepared the seven altars and i have offered up a bullock and a ram on every
the lord put a word in mouth and said unto balak and thus thou shalt
he returned unto him and lo he stood by his burntoffering he and all the princes of moab
he took up his parable and said from aram balak bringeth me the king of moab from the mountains of the east curse me jacob and come execrate
how shall i curse whom god hath not cursed and how shall i execrate whom the lord hath not execrated
for from the top of the rocks i see him and from the hills i behold him lo it is a people that shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations
who hath counted the dust of jacob or numbered the stock of israel let me die the death of the righteous and let mine end be like his
and balak said unto balaam hast thou done unto me i took thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast blessed them
he answered and said i not take heed to speak that which the lord putteth in my
balak said unto him i pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou mayest see them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt not see them all and curse me them from
he took him into the field of zophim to the top of pisgah and built seven altars and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar
he said unto balak here by thy burntoffering while i go toward a meeting
and the lord met balaam and put a word in his mouth and said unto balak and thus shalt thou
and he came to him and lo he stood by his burntoffering and the princes of moab with him and balak said unto him hath the lord
he took up his parable and said arise balak and hear give ear unto me thou son of zippor
god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent when he hath said will he not do it or when he hath spoken will he not make it good
behold i am bidden to bless and when he hath blessed i cannot call it back
none hath beheld iniquity in jacob
numbers neither hath one seen perverseness in israel the lord his god is with him and the shouting for the king is among them
god who brought them forth out of egypt is for them like the lofty horns of the wildox
for there is no enchantment with jacob neither is there any divination with israel now is it said of jacob and of israel hath god wrought
behold a people that riseth up as a lioness and as a lion doth he lift himself up he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey and drink the blood of the slain
and balak said unto balaam curse them at all nor bless them at
balaam answered and said unto balak not i thee saying all that the lord speaketh that i must
balak said unto balaam now i will take thee unto another place peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse me them from
balak took balaam unto the top of peor that looketh down upon the desert
balaam said unto balak me here seven altars and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven
balak did as balaam had said and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar
and when balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless israel he went not as at the other times to meet with enchantments but he set his face toward the wilderness
and balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw israel dwelling tribe by tribe and the spirit of god came upon him
he took up his parable and said the saying of balaam the son of beor and the saying of the man whose eye is opened
the saying of him who heareth the words of god who seeth the vision of the almighty fallen down yet with opened eyes
how goodly are thy tents o jacob thy dwellings o israel
as valleys stretched out as gardens by the riverside as aloes planted of the lord as cedars beside the waters
water shall flow from his branches and his seed shall be in many waters and his king shall be higher than agag and his kingdom shall be exalted
god who brought him forth out of egypt is for him like the lofty horns of the wildox he shall eat up the nations that are his adversaries and shall break their bones in pieces
numbers and pierce them through with his arrows
he couched he lay down as a lion and as a lioness who shall rouse him up blessed be every one that blesseth thee and cursed be every one that curseth thee
and anger was kindled against balaam and he smote his hands together and balak said unto balaam called thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast altogether blessed them these three times
now flee thou to thy place i thought to promote thee unto great honour but lo the lord hath kept thee back from
balaam said unto balak i not also to thy messengers that thou didst send unto me saying
balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the word of the lord to do either good or bad of mine own mind what the lord speaketh that will i speak
now behold i go unto my people come and i will announce to thee what this people shall do to thy people in the end of
he took up his parable and said the saying of balaam the son of beor and the saying of the man whose eye is opened
the saying of him who heareth the words of god and knoweth the knowledge of the most high who seeth the vision of the almighty fallen down yet with opened eyes
i see him but not now i behold him but not nigh there shall step forth a star out of jacob and a scepter shall rise out of israel and shall smite through the corners of moab and break down all the sons of seth
and edom shall be a possession seir also even his enemies shall be a possession while israel doeth valiantly
and out of jacob shall one have dominion and shall destroy the remnant from the city
and he looked on amalek and took up his parable and said amalek was the first of the nations but his end shall come to destruction
and he looked on the kenite and took up his parable and said though firm be thy dwellingplace and though thy nest be set in the rock
nevertheless kain shall be wasted how long asshur shall carry thee away captive
numbers
and he took up his parable and said alas who shall live after god hath appointed him
but ships shall come from the coast of kittim and they shall afflict asshur and shall afflict eber and he also shall come to destruction when phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest saw it he rose up from the midst of the congregation and took a spear in his hand
he went after the man of israel into the chamber and thrust both of them through the man of israel and the woman through her belly so the plague was stayed from the children of israel
those that died by the plague were twenty and four thousand
and balaam rose up and went and returned to his place and balak also went his way
and israel abode in shittim and the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of moab

and the lord said unto moses all the chiefs of the people and hang them up unto the lord in face of the sun that the fierce anger of the lord may turn away from
moses said unto the judges of israel ye every one his men that have joined themselves unto the baal of
behold one of the children of israel came and brought unto his brethren a midianitish woman in the sight of moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of israel while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting
and the lord spoke unto moses saying
the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away from the children of israel in that he was very jealous for my sake among them so that i consumed not the children of israel in my jealousy
say behold i give unto him my covenant of peace
and it shall be unto him and to his seed after him the covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was jealous for his god and made atonement for the children of

and moses spoke unto the heads of the tribes of the children of israel saying this is the thing which the lord hath commanded
a man voweth a vow unto the lord or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth
when a woman voweth a vow unto the lord and bindeth herself by a bond being in her house in her youth
her father heareth her vow or her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul and her father holdeth his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand
if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth none of her vows or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand and the lord will forgive her because her father
numbers disallowed her
if she be married to a husband while her vows are upon her or the clear utterance of her lips wherewith she hath bound her soul
and her husband hear it whatsoever day it be that he heareth it and hold his peace at her then her vows shall stand and her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand
if her husband disallow her in the day that he heareth it then he shall make void her vow which is upon her and the clear utterance of her lips wherewith she hath bound her soul and the lord will forgive her
the vow of a widow or of her that is divorced even every thing wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand against her
and if a woman vowed in her house or bound her soul by a bond with an oath
her husband heard it and held his peace at her and disallowed her not then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand
if her husband make them null and void in the day that he heareth them then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips whether it were her vows or the bond of her soul shall not stand her husband hath made them void and the lord will forgive her
vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul her husband may let it stand or her husband may make it void
but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day then he causeth all her vows to stand or all her bonds which are upon her he hath let them stand because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them
if he shall make them null and void after that he hath heard them then he shall bear her iniquity
are the statutes which the lord commanded moses between a man and his wife between a father and his daughter being in her youth in her house and the lord spoke unto moses saying
the children of israel of the midianites afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy
moses spoke unto the people saying ye men from among you for the war that they may go against midian to execute the vengeance on midian
every tribe a thousand throughout all the tribes of israel shall ye send to the
there were delivered out of the thousands of israel a thousand of every tribe twelve thousand armed for war
moses sent them a thousand of every tribe to the war them and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest to the war with the holy vessels and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand
they warred against midian as the lord commanded moses and they slew every male
and they slew the kings of midian with the rest of their slain evi and rekem and zur and hur and reba the five kings of midian balaam also the son of beor they slew with the sword
the children of israel took captive the women of midian and their
numbers little ones and all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods they took for a prey
all their cities in the places wherein they dwelt and all their encampments they burnt with fire
they took all the spoil and all the prey both of man and of beast
and they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto moses and unto eleazar the priest and unto the congregation of the children of israel unto the camp unto the plains of moab which are by the jordan at jericho
and moses and eleazar the priest and all the princes of the congregation went forth to meet them without the camp
moses was wroth with the officers of the host the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds who came from the service of the war
moses said unto them ye saved all the women alive
these caused the children of israel through the counsel of balaam to revolt so as to break faith with the lord in the matter of peor and so the plague was among the congregation of the lord
therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him
but all the women children that have not known man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves
encamp ye without the camp seven days whosoever hath killed any person and whosoever hath touched any slain purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day ye and your captives
as to every garment and all that is made of skin and all work of and all things made of wood ye shall
and eleazar the priest said unto the men of war that went to the battle is the statute of the law which the lord hath commanded moses
howbeit the gold and the silver the brass the iron the tin and the lead
every thing that may abide the fire ye shall make to go through the fire and it shall be clean nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of sprinkling and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make to go through the water
ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and ye shall be clean and afterward ye may come into the
and the lord spoke unto moses saying
the sum of the prey that was taken both of man and of beast thou and eleazar the priest and the heads of the of the congregation
divide the prey into two parts between the men skilled in war that went out to battle and all the congregation
levy a tribute unto the lord of the men of war that went out to battle one soul of five hundred both of the persons and of the beeves and of the asses and of the flocks
it of their half and give it unto eleazar the priest as a portion set apart for the lord
of the children of half thou shalt take one drawn out of every fifty of
numbers the persons of the beeves of the asses and of the flocks even of all the cattle and give them unto the levites that keep the charge of the tabernacle of the
moses and eleazar the priest did as the lord commanded moses
the prey over and above the booty which the men of war took was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep
threescore and twelve thousand beeves
threescore and one thousand asses
thirty and two thousand persons in all of the women that had not known man by lying with him
the half which was the portion of them that went out to war was in number three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep
the tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen
the beeves were thirty and six thousand of which the tribute was threescore and twelve
the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred of which the tribute was threescore and one
the persons were sixteen thousand of whom the tribute was thirty and two persons

and of the children of half which moses divided off from the men that
the half was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep
thirty and six thousand beeves
thirty thousand and five hundred asses
sixteen thousand
of the children of half moses took one drawn out of every fifty both of man and of beast and gave them unto the levites that kept the charge of the tabernacle of the lord as the lord commanded moses
and the officers that were over the thousands of the host the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds came near unto moses
and they said unto moses servants have taken the sum of the men of war that are under our charge and there lacketh not one man of us
and we have brought the offering what every man hath gotten of jewels of gold armlets and bracelets signetrings earrings and girdles to make atonement for our souls before the
moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of them even all wrought jewels
all the gold of the gift that they set apart for the lord of the captains of thousands and of the captains of hundreds was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty
the men of war had taken booty every man for
moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting for a memorial for the children of israel before the lord
numbers
now the children of reuben and the children of gad had a very great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of jazer and the land of gilead that behold the place was a place for cattle
children of gad and the children of reuben came and spoke unto moses and to eleazar the priest and unto the princes of the congregation saying
and dibon and jazer and nimrah and heshbon and elealeh and sebam and nebo and beon
land which the lord smote before the congregation of israel is a land for cattle and thy servants have
and they said we have found favour in thy sight let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession bring us not over the
moses said unto the children of gad and to the children of reuben your brethren go to the war and shall ye sit here
wherefore will ye turn away the heart of the children of israel from going over into the land which the lord hath given them
did your fathers when i sent them from kadeshbarnea to see the land
when they went up unto the valley of eshcol and saw the land they turned away the heart of the children of israel that they should not go into the land which the lord had given them
the anger was kindled in that day and he swore saying
none of the men that came up out of egypt from twenty years old and upward shall see the land which i swore unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob because they have not wholly followed me
save caleb the son of jephunneh the kenizzite and joshua the son of nun because they have wholly followed the lord
the anger was kindled against israel and he made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the lord was consumed
and behold ye are risen up in your a brood of sinful men to augment yet the fierce anger of the lord toward israel
if ye turn away from after him he will yet again leave them in the wilderness and so ye will destroy all this
and they came near unto him and said will build sheepfolds here for our cattle and cities for our little ones

he had smitten sihon the king of the amorites who dwelt in heshbon and og the king of bashan who dwelt in ashtaroth at edrei
the jordan in the land of moab took moses upon him to expound this law saying
lord our god spoke unto us in horeb saying have dwelt long enough in this mountain
you and take your journey and go to the hillcountry of the amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto in the arabah in the hillcountry and in the lowland and in the south and by the seashore the land of the canaanites and lebanon as far as the great river the river euphrates
behold i have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the lord swore unto your fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give unto them and to their seed after
and i spoke unto you at that time saying am not able to bear you myself alone
lord your god hath multiplied you and behold ye are this day as the stars of heaven for
lord the god of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are and bless you as he hath promised
how can i myself alone bear your cumbrance and your burden and your strife
you from each one of your tribes wise men and understanding and full of knowledge and i will make them heads over
and ye answered me and said thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to
i took the heads of your tribes wise men and full of knowledge and made them heads over you captains of thousands and captains of hundreds and captains of fifties and captains of tens and officers tribe by tribe
i charged your judges at that time saying the causes between your brethren and judge righteously between a man and his brother and the stranger that is with him
shall not respect persons in judgment ye shall hear the small and the great alike ye shall not
deuteronomy be afraid of the face of any man for the judgment is and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me and i will hear
i commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do
and we journeyed from horeb and went through all that great and dreadful wilderness which ye saw by the way to the hillcountry of the amorites as the lord our god commanded us and we came to kadeshbarnea
i said unto you are come unto the hillcountry of the amorites which the lord our god giveth unto us
the lord thy god hath set the land before thee go up take possession as the lord the god of thy fathers hath spoken unto thee fear not neither be
and ye came near unto me every one of you and said us send men before us that they may search the land for us and bring us back word of the way by which we must go up and the cities unto which we shall
and the thing pleased me well and i took twelve men of you one man for every tribe
they turned and went up into the mountains and came unto the valley of eshcol and spied it out
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down unto us and brought us back word and said is the land which the lord our god giveth unto
ye would not go up but rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god
ye murmured in your tents and said the lord hated us he hath brought us forth out of the land of egypt to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us
whither are we going up our brethren have made our heart to melt saying the people is greater and taller than we the cities are great and fortified up to heaven and moreover we have seen the sons of the anakim
i said unto you not neither be afraid of them
lord your god who goeth before you he shall fight for you according to all that he did for you in egypt before your eyes
in the wilderness where thou hast seen how that the lord thy god bore thee as a man doth bear his son in all the way that ye went until ye came unto this place
yet in this thing ye do not believe the lord your god
went before you in the way to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in in fire by night to show you by what way ye should go and in the cloud by
and the lord heard the voice of your words and was wroth and swore saying
there shall not one of these men even this evil generation see the good land which i swore to give unto your fathers
caleb the son of jephunneh he shall see it and to him will i give the land that he hath trodden upon and to his children because he hath wholly followed the

the son
deuteronomy of nun who standeth before thee he shall go in thither encourage thou him for he shall cause israel to inherit it
your little ones that ye said should be a prey and your children that this day have no knowledge of good or evil they shall go in thither and unto them will i give it and they shall possess it
as for you turn you and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the red
ye answered and said unto me have sinned against the lord we will go up and fight according to all that the lord our god commanded and ye girded on every man his weapons of war and deemed it a light thing to go up into the hillcountry
the lord said unto me unto them go not up neither fight for i am not among you lest ye be smitten before your
i spoke unto you and ye hearkened not but ye rebelled against the commandment of the lord and were presumptuous and went up into the hillcountry
the amorites that dwell in that hillcountry came out against you and chased you as bees do and beat you down in seir even unto hormah
and ye returned and wept before the lord but the lord hearkened not to your voice nor gave ear unto you
ye abode in kadesh many days according unto the days that ye abode there then we turned and took our journey into the wilderness by the
way to the red sea as the lord spoke unto me and we compassed mount seir many days
and the lord spoke unto me saying
have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward
command thou the people saying ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of esau that dwell in seir and they will be afraid of you take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore
contend not with them for i will not give you of their land no not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on because i have given mount seir unto esau for a possession

the lord thy god hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand he hath known thy walking through this great wilderness these forty years the lord thy god hath been with thee thou hast lacked
so we passed by from our brethren the children of esau that dwell in seir from the way of the arabah from elath and from eziongeber and we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of moab

moreover the hand of the lord was against them to discomfit them from the midst of the camp until they were consumed
so it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people
the lord spoke unto me saying

thy distress when all these things are come upon thee in the end of days thou wilt return to the lord thy god and hearken unto his voice

when thou hast eaten and art satisfied and hast built goodly houses and dwelt therein
and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply and thy silver and thy gold is
deuteronomy multiplied and all that thou hast is multiplied
thy heart be lifted up and thou forget the lord thy god who brought thee forth out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage
who led thee through the great and dreadful wilderness wherein were serpents fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where was no water who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint

the nations that the lord maketh to perish before you so shall ye perish because ye would not hearken unto the voice of the lord your god hear o israel thou art to pass over the jordan this day to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than thyself cities great and fortified up to heaven
people great and tall the sons of the anakim whom thou knowest and of whom
thou hast heard say can stand before the sons of
therefore this day that the lord thy god is he who goeth over before thee as a devouring fire he will destroy them and he will bring them down before thee so shalt thou drive them out and make them to perish quickly as the lord hath spoken unto thee
speak not thou in thy heart after that the lord thy god hath thrust them out from before thee saying my righteousness the lord hath brought me in to possess this whereas for the wickedness of these nations the lord doth drive them out from before thee
for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thy heart dost thou go in to possess their land but for the wickedness of these nations the lord thy god doth drive them out from before thee and that he may establish the word which the lord swore unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob
therefore that it is not for thy righteousness that the lord thy god giveth thee this good land to possess it for thou art a stiffnecked people
remember forget thou not how thou didst make the lord thy god wroth in the wilderness from the day that thou didst go forth out of the land of egypt until ye came unto this place ye have been rebellious against the lord
in horeb ye made the lord wroth and the lord was angered with you to have destroyed you
when i was gone up into the mount to
deuteronomy receive the tables of stone even the tables of the covenant which the lord made with you then i abode in the mount forty days and forty nights i did neither eat bread nor drink water
and the lord delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of god and on them was written according to all the words which the lord spoke with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly
it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that the lord gave me the two tables of stone even the tables of the covenant
the lord said unto me get thee down quickly from hence for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of egypt have dealt corruptly they are quickly turned aside out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten
the lord spoke unto me saying have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people
me alone that i may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven and i will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than
i turned and came down from the mount and the mount burned with fire and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands
i looked and behold ye had sinned against the lord your god ye had made you a molten calf ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the lord had commanded you
i took hold of the two tables and cast them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes
i fell down before the lord as at the first forty days and forty nights i did neither eat bread nor drink water because of all your sin which ye sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him
i was in dread of the anger and hot displeasure wherewith the lord was wroth against you to destroy you but the lord hearkened unto me that time also
moreover the lord was very angry with aaron to have destroyed him and i prayed for aaron also the same time
and i took your sin the calf which ye had made and burnt it with fire and beat it in pieces grinding it very small until it was as fine as dust and i cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the
at taberah and at massah and at kibrothhattaavah ye made the lord wroth
when the lord sent you from kadeshbarnea saying up and possess the land which i have given then ye rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god and ye believed him not nor hearkened to his voice
have been rebellious against the lord from the day that i knew
i fell down before the lord the forty days and forty nights that i fell down because the lord had said he would destroy you
i prayed unto the lord and said lord god destroy not thy people and thine inheritance
deuteronomy that thou hast redeemed through thy greatness that thou hast brought forth out of egypt with a mighty hand
remember thy servants abraham isaac and jacob look not unto the stubbornness of this people nor to their wickedness nor to their sin
the land whence thou broughtest us out say because the lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised unto them and because he hated them he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness
yet they are thy people and thine inheritance that thou didst bring out by thy great power and by thy outstretched at that time the lord said unto me thee two tables of stone like unto the first and come up unto me into the mount and make thee an ark of wood
i will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou didst break and thou shalt put them in the
i made an ark of acaciawood and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and went up into the mount having the two tables in my hand
and he wrote on the tables according to the first writing the ten words which the lord spoke unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly and the lord gave them unto me
i turned and came down from the mount and put the tables in the ark which i had made and there they are as the lord commanded
the children
of israel journeyed from beerothbenejaakan to moserah there aaron died and there he was buried and eleazar his son ministered in the office in his stead
thence they journeyed unto gudgod and from gudgod to jotbah a land of brooks of
that time the lord separated the tribe of levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the lord to stand before the lord to minister unto him and to bless in his name unto this day
levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren the lord is his inheritance according as the lord thy god spoke unto
i stayed in the mount as at the first time forty days and forty nights and the lord hearkened unto me that time also the lord would not destroy thee
the lord said unto me go before the people causing them to set forward that they may go in and possess the land which i swore unto their fathers to give unto
and now israel what doth the lord thy god require of thee but to fear the lord thy god to walk in all his ways and to love him and to serve the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul
keep for thy good the commandments of the lord and his statutes which i command thee this day
unto the lord thy god belongeth the heaven and the heaven of heavens the earth with all that therein is
the lord had a delight in thy fathers to
deuteronomy love them and he chose their seed after them even you above all peoples as it is this day
therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no more stiffnecked
the lord your god he is god of gods and lord of lords the great god the mighty and the awful who regardeth not persons nor taketh reward
doth execute justice for the fatherless and widow and loveth the stranger in giving him food and raiment
ye therefore the stranger for ye were strangers in the land of egypt
shalt fear the lord thy god him shalt thou serve and to him shalt thou cleave and by his name shalt thou swear
is thy glory and he is thy god that hath done for thee these great and tremendous things which thine eyes have seen
fathers went down into egypt with threescore and ten persons and now the lord thy god hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude therefore thou shalt love the lord thy god and keep his charge and his statutes and his ordinances and his commandments alway
know ye this day for i speak not with your children that have not known and that have not seen the chastisement of the lord your god his greatness his mighty hand and his outstretched arm
his signs and his works which he did in the midst of egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt and unto all his land
what he did unto the army of egypt
unto their horses and to their chariots how he made the water of the red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you and how the lord hath destroyed them unto this day
what he did unto you in the wilderness until ye came unto this place
what he did unto dathan and abiram the sons of eliab the son of reuben how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their households and their tents and every living substance that followed them in the midst of all israel
your eyes have seen all the great work of the lord which he did
shall ye keep all the commandment which i command thee this day that ye may be strong and go in and possess the land whither ye go over to possess it
that ye may prolong your days upon the land which the lord swore unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed a land flowing with milk and honey
for the land whither thou goest in to possess it is not as the land of egypt from whence ye came out where thou didst sow thy seed and didst water it with thy foot as a garden of herbs
the land whither ye go over to possess it is a land of hills and valleys and drinketh water as the rain of heaven cometh down
land which the lord thy god careth for the eyes of the lord thy god are always upon it from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year
deuteronomy
and it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which i command you this day to love the lord your god and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul
i will give the rain of your land in its season the former rain and the latter rain that thou mayest gather in thy corn and thy wine and thine oil
i will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle and thou shalt eat and be satisfied
heed to yourselves lest your heart be deceived and ye turn aside and serve other gods and worship them
the anger of the lord be kindled against you and he shut up the heaven so that there shall be no rain and the ground shall not yield her fruit and ye perish quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you
therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes
ye shall teach them your children talking of them when thou sittest in thy house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up
thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house and upon thy gates
your days may be multiplied and the days of your children upon the land which the lord swore unto your fathers to give them as the days of the heavens above the earth
for if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which i command you to do it to love the lord your god to walk in all his ways and to cleave unto him
will the lord drive out all these nations from before you and ye shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves

the curse if ye shall not hearken unto the commandments of the lord your god but turn aside out of the way which i command you this day to go after other gods which ye have not known
and it shall come to pass when the lord thy god shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it that thou shalt set the blessing upon mount gerizim and the curse upon mount ebal

notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh within all thy gates after
deuteronomy all the desire of thy soul according to the blessing of the lord thy god which he hath given thee the unclean and the clean may eat thereof as of the gazelle and as of the hart

i know that after my death ye will in any wise deal corruptly and turn aside from the way which i have commanded you and evil will befall you in the end of days because ye will do that which is evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him through the work of your
moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of israel the words of this song until they were finished
give ear ye heavens and i will speak and let the earth hear the words of my mouth
my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the dew as the small rain upon the tender grass and as the showers upon the herb
for i will proclaim the name of the lord ascribe ye greatness unto our god
the rock his work is perfect for all his ways are justice a god of faithfulness and without iniquity just and right is he
deuteronomy
is corruption his no his is the blemish a generation crooked and perverse
do ye thus requite the lord o foolish people and unwise is not he thy father that hath gotten thee hath he not made thee and established thee the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him
he made him ride on the high places of the earth and he did eat the fruitage of the field and he made him to suck honey out of the crag and oil out of the flinty rock
curd of kine and milk of sheep with fat of lambs and rams of the breed of bashan and hegoats with the kidneyfat of wheat and of the blood of the grape thou drankest foaming wine
remember the days of old consider the years of many generations ask thy father and he will declare unto thee thine elders and they will tell thee
when the most high gave to the nations when he separated the children of men he set the borders of the peoples according to the number of the children of israel
for the portion of the lord is his people jacob the lot of his inheritance
but jeshurun waxed fat and thou didst wax fat thou didst grow thick thou didst become and he forsook god who made him and contemned the rock of his salvation
they roused him to jealousy with strange gods with abominations did they provoke him
they sacrificed unto demons nogods gods that they knew not new gods that came up of late which your fathers dreaded not
of the rock that begot thee thou wast unmindful and didst forget god that bore thee
he found him in a desert land and in the waste a howling wilderness he compassed him about he cared for him he kept him as the apple of his eye
as an eagle that stirreth up her nest hovereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her
deuteronomy
and the lord saw and spurned because of the provoking of his sons and his daughters
and he said will hide my face from them i will see what their end shall be for they are a very froward generation children in whom is no faithfulness
they have roused me to jealousy with a nogod they have provoked me with their vanities and i will rouse them to jealousy with a nopeople i will provoke them with a vile nation
a fire is kindled in my nostril and burneth unto the depths of the netherworld and devoureth the earth with her produce and setteth ablaze the foundations of the mountains the suckling with the man of gray hairs
i thought i would make an end of them i would make their memory cease from among men
were it not that i dreaded the provocation lest their adversaries should misdeem lest they should say our hand is exalted and not the lord hath wrought all
for they are a nation void of counsel and there is no understanding in them
if they were wise they would understand this they would discern their latter end
how should one chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their rock had given them over and the lord had delivered them up
for their rock is not as our rock even our enemies themselves being judges
for their vine is of the vine of sodom and of the fields of gomorrah their grapes are grapes of gall their clusters are bitter
their wine is the venom of serpents
i will heap evils upon them i will spend mine arrows upon them
the wasting of hunger and the devouring of the fiery bolt and bitter destruction and the teeth of beasts will i send upon them with the venom of crawling things of the dust
without shall the sword bereave and in the chambers terror slaying both young man and virgin
deuteronomy and the cruel poison of asps and say as i live for ever
if i whet my glittering sword and my hand take hold on judgment i will render vengeance to mine adversaries and will recompense them that hate me
i will make mine arrows drunk with blood and my sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives from the longhaired heads of the not this laid up in store with me sealed up in my treasuries
vengeance is mine and recompense against the time when their foot shall slip for the day of their calamity is at hand and the things that are to come upon them shall make haste
for the lord will judge his people and repent himself for his servants when he seeth that their stay is gone and there is none remaining shut up or left at large
and it is said where are their gods the rock in whom they trusted
who did eat the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drinkoffering let him rise up and help you let him be your protection
see now that i even i am he and there is no god with me i kill and i make alive i have wounded and i heal and there is none that can deliver out of my hand
for i lift up my hand to heaven
sing aloud o ye nations of his people for he doth avenge the blood of his servants and doth render vengeance to his adversaries and doth make expiation for the land of his people
and moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people he and hoshea the son of nun
when moses made an end of speaking all these words to all israel
said unto them your heart unto all the words wherewith i testify against you this day that ye may charge your children therewith to observe to do all the words of this law
for it is no vain thing for you because it is your life and through this thing ye shall prolong your days upon
deuteronomy the land whither ye go over the jordan to possess
and the lord spoke unto moses that selfsame day saying
thee up into this mountain of abarim unto mount nebo which is in the land of moab that is over against jericho and behold the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel for a possession
die in the mount whither thou goest up and be gathered unto thy people as aaron thy brother died in mount hor and was gathered unto his people
ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of israel at the waters of meribathkadesh in the wilderness of zin because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of israel
for thou shalt see the land afar off but thou shalt not go thither into the land which i give the children of receiving of thy words
moses commanded us a law an inheritance of the congregation of jacob
and there was a king in jeshurun when the heads of the people were gathered all the tribes of israel together
let reuben live and not die in that his men become few
and this for judah and he said hear lord the voice of judah and bring him in unto his people his hands shall contend for him and thou shalt be a help against his adversaries
and of levi he said thy thummim and thy urim be with thy holy one whom thou didst prove at massah with whom thou didst strive at the waters of meribah
who said of his father and of his mother have not seen neither did he acknowledge his brethren nor knew he his own children for they have observed thy word and keep thy covenant
they shall teach jacob thine ordinances and israel thy law they shall put incense before thee and whole burntoffering upon thine altar
and this is the blessing wherewith moses the man of god blessed the children of israel before his death
he said the lord came from sinai and rose from seir unto them he shined forth from mount paran and he came from the myriads holy at his right hand was a fiery law unto them
yea he loveth the peoples all his holy are in thy hand and they sit down at thy feet
deuteronomy
bless lord his substance and accept the work of his hands smite through the loins of them that rise up against him and of them that hate him that they rise not again his firstling bullock majesty is his and his horns are the horns of the wildox with them he shall gore the peoples all of them even the ends of the earth and they are the ten thousands of ephraim and they are the thousands of manasseh
of benjamin he said the beloved of the lord shall dwell in safety by him he covereth him all the day and he dwelleth between his shoulders
and of zebulun he said rejoice zebulun in thy going out and issachar in thy tents
they shall call peoples unto the mountain there shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness for they shall suck the abundance of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand
and of joseph he said blessed of the lord be his land for the precious things of heaven for the dew and for the deep that coucheth beneath
and for the precious things of the fruits of the sun and for the precious things of the yield of the moons
and for the tops of the ancient mountains and for the precious things of the everlasting hills
and for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof and the good will of him that dwelt in the bush let the blessing come upon the head of joseph and upon the crown of the head of him that is prince among his brethren
and of gad he said blessed be he that enlargeth gad he dwelleth as a lioness and teareth the arm yea the crown of the head
and he chose a first part for himself for there a portion of a ruler was reserved and there came the heads of the people he executed the righteousness of the lord and his ordinances with israel
deuteronomy
and of dan he said dan is a whelp that leapeth forth from bashan and that is the sword of thy excellency and thine enemies shall dwindle away before thee and thou shalt tread upon their high places
and of naphtali he said o naphtali satisfied with favour and full with the blessing of the lord possess thou the sea and the south
and of asher he said blessed be asher above sons let him be the favoured of his brethren and let him dip his foot in oil
iron and brass shall be thy bars and as thy days so shall thy strength be
there is none like unto god o jeshurun who rideth upon the heaven as thy help and in his excellency on the skies
the eternal god is a dwellingplace and underneath are the everlasting arms and he thrust out the enemy from before thee and said
and israel dwelleth in safety the fountain of jacob alone in a land of corn and wine yea his heavens drop down dew
happy art thou o israel who is like unto thee a people saved by the lord the shield of thy help
and moses went up from the plains of moab unto mount nebo to the top of pisgah that is over against jericho and the lord showed him all the land even gilead as far as dan
all naphtali and the land of ephraim and manasseh and all the land of judah as far as the hinder sea
and the south and the plain even the valley of jericho the city of palmtrees as far as zoar
the lord said unto him is the land which i swore unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob saying i will give it unto thy seed i have caused thee to see it with thine eyes but thou shalt not go over
moses the servant of the lord died there in the land of moab according to the word of the lord
and he was buried in the valley in the land of moab over against bethpeor and no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day
moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated
the children of israel wept for moses in the plains of moab thirty days so the days of weeping in the mourning for moses were ended
joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom for moses had laid his hands upon
deuteronomy him and the children of israel hearkened unto him and did as the lord commanded moses
there hath not arisen a prophet since in israel like unto moses whom the lord knew face to face
all the signs and the wonders which the lord sent him to do in the land of egypt to pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land
in all the mighty hand and in all the great terror which moses wrought in the sight of all israel
